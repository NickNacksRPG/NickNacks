# General Thoughts

Races don't give ability scores. Now you can choose your race based on what features you want. Bring out the jacked fairies and the clumsy elves!

Most races have a racial language, but also know common.\
All creatures are assumed to have a base speed of 30ft.

Keep in mind a lot of the lore I use to describe races is used to differentiate a given race from the others. I personally donâ€™t appreciate when elves are just long pretty people. I also make it to give people a starting point if they don't know how to roleplay or world build with a specific race.

The descriptions you find here (or in any source really) are specifically tailored to a setting, or are the brain child of some other fantasy obsessed weirdo. They do not need to match how a specific race exists in your world if you have something else in mind.

For example...\
In the world I built my Lore around, Nack, elves primarily live in a continent known as "The Land of Storms" which has an absurdly high level of rainfall. As such, they developed a spell to combat it called Umbrella, which Elves often inherently learn, separate from any additional magic training. Doesn't make much sense for a subterranean elf now does it?

Races very often offer skill bonuses. Skill bonuses from race do not stack unless the two features are a pair of minor and major features. So you couldn't pick goblin and get perception from mixed blood elf's "nice ears" for instance.

The only exception to this is if the skill bonuses only apply to specific circumstances, such as a cyborgs sentinel build.
