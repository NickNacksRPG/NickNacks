<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="144"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Numbers</td><td>Exalted stand around 5'6 and weigh around 150 lbs<br>Exalted are adults by 15 and live to be around 70 years old. Fallen typically appear as they did in adulthood for 50 years before passing.</td></tr><tr><td>Exalted</td><td><p>This race comes in 2 different forms, the more common is the exalted. These are creatures born from a mortal humanoid and a heavenly god. Exalted children usually only know one of their parents personally. Their heavenly parent usually only takes a passing interest in their mortal children, unless they are particularly devoted followers or they accrue a great deal of influence.</p><p>Exalted that do know of their divine heritage often go to great lengths to impress their deific parent. The silence they experience is painful, but the satisfaction when they are finally acknowledged is immeasurable. Exalted can often feel great pressure to live in ways that reflect an unflinching moral compass. People will often put them on pedestals as the chosen ones of their god: A birthright that does not correspond with the personal thoughts and feelings of the exalted can create a lot of cognitive dissonance. Unhappy exalted tend to break away from their roots in very dramatic and drastic fashions.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Fallen</td><td>The less common form is the fallen. These were creatures that passed away and through their deeds in life were granted access to the heavens in the afterlife. At one point or another though, they broke rules dealing with fiends, sneaking people into the heavens or some other particularly heinous act. As punishment, they are forced to drink from the river styx, forgetting much of their past selves. Then they are banished to the mortal realm, often living hallow lives, but never understanding where that feeling comes from.<br>The touch of divinity never truly leaves them, however. Essentially reborn as adults, Fallen are often drawn to doing the same types of righteous things they did in life to earn their place among the greats. Fragments of memories from their previous lives remain, and what they remember can drastically change their outlook. Sometimes they can create hope that one day they may return, but in others, it only creates spite for the harshest punishment imaginable.</td></tr><tr><td>Appearance and Biology</td><td>The exalted closely resemble the race of their mortal parent, but with bonus shinyness. They might have a metallic sheen to their hair, eyes that glow a solid gold, cracks along their body filled with gold or other such visually distinct changes. Universally they all have halos of some kind.<br>Fallen resemble the appearance they had in life, but often with the color drained from them, supplemented by black. Their skin tends towards a gray porcelain, their hair, black. If they have wings, they will often have both black and white feathers.<br>Exalted can reproduce freely with mortals, but without any attention from their deific parent, the children are born as their partners race. Fallen follow the same rules, but have no chance of ever created another of their kind.</td></tr><tr><td>Exalted vs Fallen</td><td>By their natures, fallen and exalted all tend to be first generation celestials, with the celestial blood diluting with each generation. As such, encounters between exalted and fallen tend to be uncommon. They tend to have mixed feelings about each other.<br>For the exalted, they feel a mixture of pity and envy. Pity that the fallen have no place in the heavens and envy that they are unshackles from their heavenly duties. Oftentimes they will mistreat the fallen, giving them a "holier than thou" attitude. Others that feel they have failed their divine parents will reach out to the fallen and find a kinship that only someone abandoned by the gods can truly understand.<br>For the fallen, exalted represent a possible connection to the divine. This presents an opportunity for redemption, so fallen are typically a lot more excited to find exalted than the other way around. Unfortunately, many will end up disappointed; Either by the lack of enthusiasm, or the lack of connection the exalted has with the divine. Being mistreated by the exalted can make fallen feel even more jaded than they were before about the gods and how they treat mortals.</td></tr></tbody></table>
