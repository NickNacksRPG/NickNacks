The natural ebb and flow of the world caused resources like food to grow scarce. Many solutions were tried and failed but one mad scientist saw the solution that nobody else could: Half resource consumption by shrinking everyone down to half size.<br>He spent his entire life being looked down upon, and now it was going to be his turn. He created a chemical compound he called shortstackium that, even in small doses, could cause people to shrink in size significantly. He found clever ways to get this substance into the food and water supply. He put trace amounts into his potions that he sold to adventurers.<br>It was very fast acting, causing people to shrink by the time they awoke the next day. Due to its complexity and strangeness, it took a few weeks to identify the problem and another month to eliminate most of its circulation, getting its creator thrown in jail in the process. His solution was quite effective, but it completely transformed people unwillingly, often with strange side effects. No alchemist has ever managed to figure out how to reverse the effects, and the effects are passed down through children. </td></tr><tr><td>Appearance and Biology</td><td>Because shorstackium was most effective on humans, the typical pint most closely resembles humans, but pints resembling other races also exist. A great deal of genetic mutation happened as a result of initial incident. This has caused all kinds of changes to the pints.<br>Some common</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
