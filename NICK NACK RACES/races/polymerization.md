| Origin Race | Polymerizations (shortened to Poly) are fusions between a unique ooze creature and a creature they consumed. As such, they share the size and racial language of a specific race. |

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="148"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Numbers</td><td><p>Height and weight are roughly the same as the creature they consumed</p><p>Poly lead a relatively short life and split at 40.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Consumption</td><td>Once upon a time an alchemist created an ooze capable of forming a special bond with a person it consumes. They tried to kill it after it had consumed someone close to them, but poly only multiply when killed after absorbing a creature. Their death triggers a reaction where they split into two unintelligent amorphous blobs that seek creatures to consume. Since this event, they have slowly spread. Some non-poly use these slime creatures as a method to continue their life after suffering health complications, other people fear their hunger for intelligent life, but most know nothing about the origin of poly.</td></tr><tr><td>Appearance and Biology</td><td><p>Poly share the general shape of the person they consumed. While poly are somewhat amorphous, this is their "true form" that they do not deviate from too much. As oozes, they are often viscous and jello-like, coming in a variety of colors. Pressing your finger to their skin, it would bend, but it would be difficult to break. They are generally at least semi-transparent.</p><p>Despite having the ability to remove imperfections, such as scars, missing teeth, slices of ear missing, poly keep these qualities. Instead the alterations they make usually add completely new features, like antennae, horns or tattoos.</p><p>Poly generally have "barbie bod" smoothing over their intimate parts, and can get away with not wearing any clothing, but many still do. When they do wear clothing, they always choose things that are exceptionally elastic to accommodate for their stretching forms</p><p>Despite having little in common with humanoids in terms of their biology, they will usually still try to mimic how creatures hold things with fingers and eat with their mouths. It can still be a bit awkward watching their food slowly dissolve in their goo (one reason why they like to wear clothing).</p></td></tr><tr><td>Memories of the Past</td><td>While it is clear that a poly loses its soul when it dies and splits, all poly are essentially clones of their "parents" combined with some other creature unfortunate enough to be eaten. Some aspects of their predecessors' consciousness seep into their own. As such, poly often have unusual senses of self. Many of their thoughts are dominated by the memories and feelings of the creature they consumed. While they rest, their dreams are often filled with memories of their previous life. Consuming creatures with particularly strong convictions can lead to the poly working to achieve similar goals. Some poly learn more about their origin and feel guilt towards what must have happened in order for them to exist. Other poly don't understand why they have a head filled with the memories of an outsider, and do everything they can to avoid things that trigger these alien memories.</td></tr></tbody></table>
