# Human

The default race.

Humans with the mixed blood trait replace the traditional half breed races. Other races with the mixed blood feature are predominantly the original race, only slightly resembling the other parent. Humans are purposefully designed to be pretty generic.&#x20;

I don't think they should be particularly different than they are in real life because they serve as an anchor for people not accustomed to fantasy. Lots of players like to play self-insert characters, and lots of DMs like to have human settlements to provide places where they don't have to think much about culture, history, mannerisms, architecture etc. I think humans are just fine as is, no changes needed. They are a nice glue to keep all the mismatched wild races of fantasy together.</td></tr></tbody></table>
