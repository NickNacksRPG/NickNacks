<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="187"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Major</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Infernal Engine</td><td>You gain resistance to fire damage. Anything you touch takes 1 fire damage per turn. This does not apply to attacks, but it does apply when you grapple or are grappled.</td></tr><tr><td>Sacrificial Pact  (Su) [healing]</td><td>By cutting yourself and bleeding on another creature as a standard action, you take (3+lvl) true damage, and heal the creature for double that amount.

You gain +4 ac, but you cannot add dexterity to AC and cannot wear armor. Natural armor also does not give poise.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="140"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Numbers</td><td><p>Stand around 5'6 and weigh around 150 lbs<br>Small variants are about half as tall and 1/5 the weight</p><p>Hellion are adults by 15 and live to be around 70 years old. When created they usually form biologically in early adulthood.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Appearance and biology</td><td><p>Hellion are roughly human shaped, but can come in many different forms. Many have spaded or forked tails they can use to grab objects. Some have vestigial wings. The most common features are a Hellion's Horns on their head. They come in all different shapes and sizes: Long curved horns like a ram, short pointed horns, multiple pairs of horns, only a single horn.<br>They often superficially resemble the race they were before their fiendish transformation with pointed elf ears or orcish tusks, but that’s where the similarities typically end. Hellion can have wildly different skin colors from crimson red to a grayish blue. Some of them even have furry digitigrade lower halves with cloven hooves.</p><p>Hellion that try to mesh well into society will dress in whatever the locals wear. As a result of how they are created, many take the opportunity to devote themselves to Brazzeria and wear her ceremonial garb. Though the stereotypical freshly created hellion will likely get piercings, decorate their horns in jewelry and wear indecent clothing just to be contrarian.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Open your Heart</td><td>Hellion are created by a Brazzerian purification ritual used on demons that were once mortal. Many fiends are beyond redemption, but those that aren't can be exposed to kindness, care and respect to slowly restore their humanity. Brazerrian priests and priestesses are able to read the hearts to fiends to tell whether they are closed or open, representing their receptiveness to healing the fiendish corruption. Over time they can (usually) be exposed to enough kindness to eventually open their heart and begin the transformation.<br>Freshly transformed hellions have no memories of their previous life before being a fiend, but they do vividly remember what happened during their time as a fiend: All of the suffering they caused, all the lives they’ve taken and all of the kindness they were treated with in order to regain their humanity. After some rehabilitation, they are given a choice to join the cause or return back to society.</td></tr><tr><td>Racism</td><td>Unfortunately for hellion, there are scars caused by fiends all over the world. Many people do not understand the intricacies of fiendish creation, or the humanity restoration the hellion undergo. As such, newly created hellion that do not stay under the protective wings of Brazzeria can often be in for a rough time. Small communities of hellion can often be found on the fringes of places where there is a great deal of Brazzerian influence.<br>The racism can go both ways; providing hardship as well as opportunity. Hellion will often find themselves getting approached by unsavory individuals looking for a new hire in their organized crime ring. They will also find it difficult to shake off the "sex demon" stereotype perpetuated by the prolific and every present succubi/twinkubi. It does serve them well when finding dates or getting jobs at brothels at least.</td></tr></tbody></table>
