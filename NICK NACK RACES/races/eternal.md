You instead rely on your telepathy in order to communicate. You are still able to create vocalizations. Silencing you disables your telepathy.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <mark style="color:green;">Major Features</mark>

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="125"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Detect Desire (Su)</td><td>With physical contact, you discover information about others through psychic impressions. Brief physical contact gives you insight into the creatures immediate goals (what's for dinner, where am I going). Intimate contact longer than 10 seconds gives you insight into the creatures long-term goals (I will become hokage, I will make cat girls real). During this contact you can also choose to share your own short/long term goals as well.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <mark style="color:green;">Minor Features</mark>

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="145"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Empathic Connection (Su)</td><td>You have advantage on skill checks against any creature you are in physical contact with (minus things where touching isn't very useful like with stealth).</td></tr><tr><td>Community [bond] (Su)</td><td>By touching another creature, you can add them to your community. All bonded creatures are capable of sending a signal of danger to their community (instant action). Every member gets a sense of direction and distance to the creature that sent the signal, and are aware of who sent it. A creature can remove its bond with 1 minute of concentration.<br>If a bonded creature receives another [bond] effect, this one returns when it ends.</td></tr></tbody></table>

You're unable to leave the plants in a position that will cause long-term damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Mind Reader (Su)</td><td>You can innately cast detect thoughts at-will, but its range changes to touch and it loses the subtle tag. You can choose to substitute the will save for an attack roll.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="148"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Numbers</td><td><p>Eternal are around 5' tall and weight around 100 lbs<br>Small eternals tend to be about half the height and a third of the weight.</p><p>Despite their name, eternals are not immortal. They reach adulthood at 20 and tend to live to about 80.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Appearance and Biology</td><td><p>Eternals are androgynous fey with very thin limbs and a similar overall "bipedal humanoid" shape. They have protrusions from the sides of the head or the face that resemble feathers that can flutter to and fro for additional expressiveness. The "default" is usually quite plain with mainly white with secondary green colors, and gem-like structures that help focus their psychic powers. Damaging this removes their ability to communicate telepathically unless they physically touch someone.</p><p>The appearance of others can vary considerably, with some borrowing features of their appearance from plants or animals. They are fans of the long and flowing fabrics of robes and dresses. Many are capable of manipulating plantlike parts of their body to grow in special shapes.</p><p>An odd quirk to the eternal is that they are genderless at birth. It isn't until they start developing romantic feelings for someone close to them over a long period of time where they undergo a rapid transformation to accommodate for their partners preferences. They still stay the same general shape, but with more desirable secondary characteristics.</p></td></tr><tr><td>"For the Greater Good"</td><td><p>Most races are capable of empathy, but few hold it in as high a regard as eternals do. In self-contained groups, their collectivist ideals and cooperative nature lead to what some might consider a socialist utopian society. However eternal society is very fragmented, and the groups tend not to interact with each other. Groups rarely have more than 200 people in them.</p><p>This does not mean that they are an insular people, just that it is very difficult for most to make the kinds of sacrifices that come naturally to eternals. While a human would readily accept no strings attached exorbitant wealth so they can indulge in the finer things of life, an eternal would question how this money was obtained. If people needed to suffer in order to produce this wealth, they would undoubtedly refuse it. Sustainability is of the utmost importance to eternals. Every action they take is an internal calculation where the desirable result is to lift everybody up. Even in personal relationships, squabbles are talked about amongst the community so grudges or trauma are worked through and "cured" before they balloon into major problems.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Branching Paths</td><td><p>As part of the advanced calculus that goes on in the head of an eternal, sometimes they deem it necessary to leave their people for the greater good. These individuals are bound to have incredibly stressful lives, as they will constantly be surrounded and people that do not share their ideals. People that hoard wealth, subjugate others and hide their emotions frustrate eternals.</p><p>Even with these hardships, they press on. They perform mental gymnastics to believe that one day all races can learn to be more like them, and they will be the ones to enact this change. They excel in any profession where their empathy and ideals can be put to good use such as diplomacy or law enforcement. In an adventuring party they lean towards supportive roles like healers.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Intimacy</td><td><p>Eternals often struggle when mingling with other races. Many of the practices that they feel are commonplace between their own people are too intimate or unusual to generally apply to other races. Physical contact, sharing feelings, collaboration, mutual respect: these are the kinds of things that the eternal will find they give too much of, and others give too little of. This can make the transition difficult. This is even worse for eternals raised outside of their own society, who almost universally feel out of place. Eternals in an abusive household will invariably end up menaces.</p><p>These things can complicate romantic relationships. Eternal require a deep, intimate connection with someone that can only be obtained through years of interactions. As such it is very common for them to be in relationships with childhood friends, even those outside of their race.</p></td></tr><tr><td>The Eternal One</td><td>The Eternal One is a collective conscience stored inside of something of significance, like a gem, or a tree. It is of great importance to the eternals since it holds the memories of their people, and is the central focus of rituals disposing of the crystalized memories of the dead. Each settlement has one, and it typically has a guardian that will consult it during times of great distress. Proclamations made by The Eternal One may as well be decrees from a god with how much severity and seriousness they are treated with. It is through these proclamations that eternals most commonly find themselves separating from their kin.</td></tr></tbody></table>
