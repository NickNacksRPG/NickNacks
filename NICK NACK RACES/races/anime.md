<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="144"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Numbers</td><td>Anime are usually around 5'6 and weigh around 150 lbs <br>If they survive early adulthood, anime live to be around 70</td></tr><tr><td>Appearance and Biology</td><td><p>Anime are very shiny, have enormous eyes, have ridiculous hair and even more ridiculous outfits. Rarely will they ever see it that way though. The more colorful and eccentric someone is, the better they fit in with a crowd of anime. Anime are obsessed with being unique and will do everything in their power to make sure they have a different hair color, eye color, outfit, hair styles etc. They care deeply about being noticed. If anybody ever mentions their appearance, that is reinforcement that they are doing something right. </p><p>Outside of these eccentricities, anime tend to closely resemble humans. Their skin and hair have a lot more luster that other humanoids. They can have deviations in their eyes, not only in their size, but also the shape of their irises. They also can sometimes have unusual extra features like the sharp teeth of a predator, an extra pair of ears on top of their head or whiskers.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Main Quest</td><td><p>Anime always have some major event that they cling to during their childhood that shapes their life forever. Tragic deaths and witnessing incredible feats of heroism are the most common, but it could also be something inconsequential like being a virgin or not having any friends. Either way, this event will put the anime down a specific path to get vengeance, be the best there ever was or watch the world burn. As such, they always spend their teenage years and early adulthood in pursuit of this goal by getting special training, isolating themselves in their research and such. Anime always make grandiose claims about their desires like "I want to become king" or "I want to be the strongest under the heavens" with regards to these desires. </p><p>Once they get their fill of adventure or they accomplish their goal is when they typically settle down and live a normal life. Occasionally anime can be tempted to come out of retirement if a rival shows up or enemy they had thought defeated rears its head.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Cranked up to 11</td><td>Anime are always the most extreme version of whatever they embody. They are the most comically evil villain's, the most epic heroes and the dumbest drunks. They dive headfirst into things without even realizing what they are doing. Anime always go all in, rarely consider future consequences and regularly trust people they shouldn't. Anime also have the most intense reactions to things. Disgust causes them to turn purple and anger turns them red while they blow steam from their ears. They make tons of vocalizations to express their current emotional state.</td></tr></tbody></table>
