<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="138"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Numbers</td><td>Cyborgs size is largely based the preferences of the creator. They usually tend to be 5'6 tall and weigh 350 lbs<br>Shadow Builds are typically half as tall and 1/4 the weight<br>Bots of Burden are typically 1.5x as tall and 4x the weight.<br>The lifespan of a cyborg is dependent on the creature used to create them. See creation and death for more info.</td></tr><tr><td>Creation (and Death)</td><td>Through a combination of engineering and magic, a talented individual can use the body of a creature who is recently deceased or on deaths door as a chassis for a cyborg. By augmenting the creature with replacement mechanical parts that circumvent the biological failings of a creature's meat parts, and offering a piece of their own soul, the creator can breathe new life into a completely new type of creature.<br>Theoretically with frequent repairs, a cyborg can live forever. However due to the soul sharing being a necessary part of the process, the life of the cyborg is inevitably tied to that of their creator. When their creator dies, they take the piece of the soul that resides in their creation with them. This does not immediately kill the cyborg, but rather gives them a sickness that is similar to dementia that slowly eats away at their mental faculties until nothing remains.</td></tr><tr><td>Appearance and Biology</td><td>The aesthetics of a cyborg tend to be augmented humanoid: Limbs replaced by mechanical parts, additional seams in the skin to accommodate for added flexibility and visible nodes/circuits to channel electricity. Other than that, the cyborg's appearance tends to be based on the preferences of the creator and the body of the creature that was used in the process of creation.<br>When it comes to what gets taken out and replaced with mechanical parts, that largely depends on the state the subject was in before the process of being turned into a cyborg. Ailments that affected mobility typically mean mechanical limbs, while those related to organ failure can cause most of the augmentations to be made internally. Either way there are usually new ways the creature can bend and new holes to accommodate for their constant need for electricity and fuel instead of food and water.<br>Most of the engineers tend to favor function over form, but on occasion they can be compelled to keep particular biological functions in tact to make the cyborgs blend in better such as a digestive system or reproductive organs. Regardless, they do not appear to age, only physically changing in so far as they are repaired and augmented further.</td></tr><tr><td>What is My Purpose</td><td><p>Cyborgs inevitably need to have their brain essentially wiped clean as part of the creation process. In order to avoid total mental collapse, the creators need to fill that space in with something else: a purpose. Usually a creatures build and purpose coincide with each other: A sleek build honed for stealth built to assassinate political rivals. Quick reflexes to counteract opponents in combat. </p><p>No matter the purpose, the cyborgs are invariably bound by it, and must dedicate a large portion of their time to it. There is no finite amount of time a cyborg must schedule, but usually they must dedicate hours each day to their purpose, even if the task is indirect (I must protect my creator, therefore I will shop for them and buy them armor). Though even indirect methods will not substitute directly attending to their build purpose forever. If a cyborg spends too much time avoiding their purpose, they acquire a severe affliction called purposelessness (details below).</p></td></tr><tr><td>Free Will</td><td>Cyborgs are like children when first created; they know little and are curious about everything. This usually passes quickly since they still have the mental faculties of an adult. Creators will quickly find them changing roles from parent to taskmaster as cyborgs are eager for direction. Once given the tools to do so, cyborgs can act completely independently. Though the words of their creator tend to carry more weight.<br>Cyborgs might not have any biological memories from their previous life, but the memories of the soul remain. They leak into their unconscious thoughts and still serve as a guide for them concerning matters of morality. They might not remember the events that created these feelings, but the lessons they learned from them stick for good. As such, they function as and are usually treated like individuals rather than servants. Though to the cyborg that line can be blurry.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <mark style="color:green;">Purposelessness (Tier 3 Affliction)</mark>



<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="553"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Effect</td><td>Cure</td></tr><tr><td><p>Cyborg loses its free will and must achieve its purpose at all costs. It is obtained through abstaining from this purpose and so usually involves overcompensating for lost time. This could mean aggressively assisting creatures without them asking for it, picking fights for no other reason than to fight.</p><p> </p><p>Cyborgs are much more impressionable and will often do anything asked of them if it is aligned with their purpose while in this state.</p></td><td><p>Receiving a direct order in line with their purpose from creator requiring at least 1 day and completing it without rest.</p><p><br>If creator is unavailable, then after 1 week of constantly serving their purpose without rest, they become drained 2 and the affliction is lost.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
