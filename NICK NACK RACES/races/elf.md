<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="140"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Numbers</td><td>Elves are usually around 6ft tall and weigh 140 lbs<br>Lifespan vary wildly with deaths by "natural causes" being exceptionally rare. As such an elven lifespan is theoretically infinite given ideal conditions.<br>Elves reach adulthood at 20 and have a median age of 300</td></tr><tr><td>Appearance and Biology</td><td>Elves are lithe androgynous humanoids with long and pointed ears as their most telling feature. Elves do not age in the traditional sense. Most humanoids start a slow decline once they reach adulthood, eventually becoming withered husks of their former selves. Elves become adults at about the same speed as humans, but when they grow old, they physically change based on things like their environment or their magical affinity. Forest hermits might eventually growing leaves and branches, stag horns or feathers. A wizard that specializes in cryomancy might turn a light shade of blue and grow cold to the touch. Changing in physical properties like these typically happen slowly over decades or even centuries.</td></tr><tr><td>Ageless</td><td><p>Elves are unique among humanoids due to their seemingly infinite longevity and youthfulness. As such, they develop a very different perception of time and the world at large. Many details are often lost to the passage of time, but elves persist. While a generation of humans might pass every 20 years or so, a generation of elves often lasts over a century. As such they have a unique perspective on the rise and fall of empires, world level crises and the passage of time in general. Elves possess a unique form of wisdom that can either be used to aid other races, or it can cause them to become jaded as they see the same pattern of self destruction emerge multiple times amongst the humanoid societies they observe.</p><p>Long life isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Elves can often develop a superiority complex; considering elves are usually the smartest or wisest person in any given room. Yearly celebrations such as birthdays are largely ignored. Elves making friends with non elves is a rarity, since they won't stick around long enough to matter anyway. Elves can often seem apathetic towards the plights of other humanoids, but their reactions have merely been tempered by experience.</p><p>Because elven society moves much more slowly than other humanoids, many of their practices can seem archaic, time-consuming and inconvenient. They are often purposefully designed to be so in order to make them take more time and be more inconvenient to replicate for other races. "See you again soon" takes on an entirely different meaning as the elf's perception of time is likely wildly different that we, and what most non-elven creatures, think. They tend to be much more conservative than others, adhering to ancient traditions and worshiping less popular or older deities. <br>Everybody is a kid at some point so they understand what it was like to some degree: What it is like to feel wonder in a world filled with the unknown. At some point people grow and the wonder and discovery of childhood is filled with responsibility and routine of adulthood. Elves eventually come to exist on some 3rd plateau of existence where they have eaten every food, vacationed in every country, saved the world, started a family, lost people they loved, turned to the dark side and were eventually redeemed and all the rest. Once you experience so much of what the world has to offer, once you have given so much of yourself to the world only to be forgotten, what is the meaning of your continued existence?</p></td></tr><tr><td>Obsession</td><td><p>The aforementioned appearance changes are merely an outward representation of decades, maybe even centuries of obsession. When traditional methods of acquiring meaning in one's life fail, elves have all the time in the world to dedicate to their projects. Spiteful elves may eventually have their conscious eroded to the point where the short-lived races are viewed as mice in their experiments, and are transformed into monsters. They might develop an entirely selfless desire to protect the natural world and view most any inhabitants that exploit it as a virus to be cured by any means necessary. Maybe at a young age they are exposed to a great evil and tirelessly work to exterminate it, and snuff out any reemergence for as long as they live.</p><p>Turning people into monsters is abhorrent, and hunting demons is noble. Protecting nature is a lofty ideal, but usually most humanoids are only willing to go as far is needed to maintain their way of life: Appeasing the spirits for safety, enriching the soil for crops etc. So a single-minded dedication to nature could easily cause conflict once one too many trees are cut. These exceptionally long-lived elves that develop obsessions don't necessarily cause conflict, but depending on their obsession, they very easily could. Entire elven societies form around the adaptive obsessions, for better or worse.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
