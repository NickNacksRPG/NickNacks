<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="139"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Numbers</td><td>Geniekin stand around 5'6 and weigh around 150 lbs<br>Earth and water geniekin tend to be slightly heavier, while air and fire tend to be lighter<br>Geniekin are adults by 15 and live to be around 70 years old.</td></tr><tr><td>Appearance and Biology</td><td><p>Geniekin are humanoids with roughly the same size and build as humans, but they come in 4 distinct variants based on their elemental affinity.<br>Air geniekin tend towards light blue skin tones and white or blonde hair. They love feeling the wind blowing in their hair so they usually will go to great lengths to maintain a large head of hair. Air geniekin are the lightest of the bunch, rarely breaking 120 lbs for even the largest of them.</p><p>Fire geniekin have red and orange skin tones, and hair that resembles fire blazing atop their heads. Male geniekin will also have facial hair with the same properties. They have a much higher body temperature than most humanoids, making them very popular in the winter.</p><p>Water geniekin skin tones vary between blue and green, depending on whether they prefer salt or freshwater. Just like with firekin, their hair can also mimic their element. It looks as though it is in a constant state of flow. Most are amphibious, capable of living comfortably in land or sea.<br>Earth geniekin are typically gray, brown, black or somewhere in between. Instead of hair, some grow crystalline structures on their head that they can mold to resemble hair. It lacks the same softness and malleability, but makes up for it with shinyness. Earthkin are the heaviest of the bunch. Their density causes them to be upwards of 200lbs.<br>The "elemental-ness" of a geniekin can vary greatly. With some being closer to humans, and others that are made of stone for example.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Like a Genie!</td><td>Geniekin are all the byproduct of genie wishes. One way or another, all of the humanoids generated through genie magic are geniekin. Wish for an army? Geniekin soldiers. Wish for a son? Geniekin. An entire planet complete with servants? Geniekin servants. Particularly large and grandiose wishes that people have made in the past have made it so the population of geniekin is steady beyond first generation wish creations.<br>Created by magic, geniekin often feel drawn to studying magic in some way, shape or form. It makes them feel as though they are getting closer to finding the origin of their species. Many geniekin are still born with a spark of that genie's magic that created them all those years, perhaps even generations ago. All they need to do is speak "I wish" and their genie powers work to shape the reality to their liking‚Ä¶albeit in less impressive and more subtle ways. It's more like gently steering reality in a desired direction than shaping it.</td></tr><tr><td>Avatar</td><td>Geniekin are the creators of the 4 bending styles. They are often drawn to each other by their natural affinity for such magic. There are many settlements that started up as a result of several earth benders or water benders meeting up and starting a school to teach. The ability to bend their respective element is the primary uniting and binding force behind geniekin society. The most highly regarded individuals among geniekin are the bending masters.<br>Benders will sometimes be given a final task by their masters to locate what they call "elemental wells." These are places that house large amounts of energy as a result of natural formations. Places like volcanoes or storms or tornadoes are common locations. These locations establish a much deeper connection between the bender and their element, and usually marks them as a master.<br>Legend has it that when the world falls into chaos, there will be someone who is capable of mastering all 4 elements, drawing power from 4 different elemental wells, and using it to bring balance to the world.</td></tr></tbody></table>
