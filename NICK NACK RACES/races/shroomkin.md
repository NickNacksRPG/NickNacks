<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="143"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Language</td><td>Sylvan</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Type</td><td>Humanoid, Plant</td></tr><tr><td>Mycotoxic Flesh<br>[poison]</td><td>You excrete a subtle poison from your pores. Prolonged contact (basically anything that isn't an attack) from something as innocuous as a handshake or hug is enough to proc the poison. When the poison takes hold, the creature stands there in a stupor, waiting for a command (fort negates). This allows you to make a simple request that can be performed quickly and easily (kiss me, do a flip, open that door). Repeated exposure eventually makes creatures immune to your poison.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="158"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Numbers</td><td>Shroomkin are generally around 5' tall and weigh about 120 lbs<br>They are adults by 10 and live to be about 50</td></tr><tr><td>Appearance</td><td>Shroomkin are humanoids whose most telling feature is their ability to grow mushrooms on their body. They feel a certain kinship towards the fungus and form a symbiotic relationship with it. The mushrooms are most common on their head, but they can grow all over: Its only a matter of where they groom that decides where they grow. In order to not be seen as monsters, most shroomkin tend to keep most of their body clean. Another telling feature is that shroomkin never have white scaleras, always favoring darker and duller colors.<br>Because shroomkin easily blend together with other races, they come in a wide variety of colors. The type of mushrooms they grow on their skin can also change very quickly due over a few generations. Certain mixes with shroomkin can create wildly different mushroom flavors from a hellion's spicy shroom to a watery geniekin's minty shroom.</td></tr><tr><td>Biology</td><td><p>Just like the mushroom itself, there's a lot more happening under the hood with shroomkin and their relationship to fungus. They constantly maintain a thin layer of mucous, making their skin always well-moisturized and slick to the touch. Shroomkin typically use this poisonous excretion as a method to mess with people, but can be used to remedy a great deal of situations, provided they can make contact to deliver it.</p><p>An interesting quirk to shroomkin biology is that when they conceive, instead of gestating over a long period of time, they grow a special mushroom (cluster?) on the exterior of their body that their child(ren) will eventually sprout from over the short period of a few weeks. Shroomkin babies are very small when compared to races of similar sizes, but they are a lot more mobile, capable of crawling, clinging and even climbing after only a few hours. This accelerated physical development continues until they reach adulthood, but their mental lags behind a few years by comparison, leading most "adult" shroomkin to more closely resemble teenagers in how they act. Shroomkin males paired with other races produce offspring of the mother's race.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Goomshroom</td><td><p>There is a specific type of fungus that only grows in areas blessed by the persistent drizzle of a goo dragon. With the shape and patterns of a mushroom and the colors and antennae of the goo dragon, the goomshroom is a treasured item that is always treated with great care. These sentient fungi live several times longer than the shroomkin and usually serve the role of a "village elder" who will pass down stories from generation to generation and be their voice of wisdom.</p><p>Shroomkin will sometimes call upon the goo dragon during times of great crises. There is no guarantee they will come, but the good nature of the goo dragon means it will usually answer the call and come to their aid. Other groups of shroomkin have a very close relationships with the goo dragons and they serve as the settlement's protector.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Blessing of the Shroomlette</td><td><p>The Shroomlette is the shroomkin god of happiness, rest and fertility. One of the few gods that exists in the realm of mortals. She resides in a garden filled with all kinds of oddities that rests on the clouds above a mushroom forest. There she resides, forever resting in a shiny cradle, waiting to be tucked in by a visitor. The Garden is commonly used as a place of mediation since all forms of violence are forbidden within the domain of the Shroomlette.</p><p>Occasionally when couples are unable to conceive or sometimes for more mysterious reasons, people will receive a blessing from  The Shroomlette. A stork will deliver a baby shroomkin girl directly to their abode with mysterious origins. Many see this as a blessing, but others who aren't happy about their newfound responsibility see it as a burden, and do everything they can to get rid of it. Those that don't treat the child with love and care incur the wrath of the Shroomlette. With poor enough treatment, she may even curse them to be an adult trapped inside of a babies body for a time to experience the some of the anguish they put the child through. </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
