# Lead Architecture

## <mark style="color:green;">Varies</mark>

Lead structures are the most expensive, but most effective way of making sure an area is safe from scrying. This is done by lining the building materials with layers of lead during construction, or as a later add on. Scrying attempts inside of lead structures always fail. Even going near the structure causes scrying magic to be faulty, obscuring the senses.

A singular room costs <mark style="color:green;">25,000g</mark>

An average home costs <mark style="color:green;">60,000g</mark>

Large or complex structures such as prisons, dungeons or palaces have a starting price of <mark style="color:green;">150,000g</mark>, which can easily increase based off the scale of the project.
