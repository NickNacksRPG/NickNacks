# Unique Special Attacks

This section is dedicated to helping you fill in the "special attack" portion of your weapon, or for giving unique weapons special abilities. See the "special attacks" section for the special attacks weapons get by default.

## <mark style="color:orange;">All Melee</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">Special Attack: Determination</mark> - Focus your conviction.  You get a +4 bonus and seeking to your next attack with this weapon. You can also choose to not attack at all with this special attack, granting your next attack with this weapon a +10 bonus instead.\
If you choose to delay this bonus, Determination does not consume your special attack next round.

<mark style="color:orange;">Special Attack: Stacking Strike</mark> - Make an attack. If this defeats the creature, stacking strike permanently gains 1 damage. Weapon specific, so you have to stack weapons individually. You cannot farm stacks passively and must gain them in combats you actually roll out.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Weapon Specific</mark>

The above special attacks can be generalized to any type of weapon. Even the "slicer" special attacks could be achieved just as effectively if you crushed a throat or foot.

However, the following weapons will specify a type of weapon you lock into, and are incompatible with each other.
