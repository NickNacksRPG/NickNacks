# Demon's Grasp

## <mark style="color:green;">1,000g (DC 11)</mark>

This green metallic gauntlet has its fingers honed at the tip like claws. Imprinted on the back of its "hand" is inscribed a slur written in infernal against fiends. It is exceptionally good at capturing the attention of fiends. When attacking with fiendish allies, they are all taunted by the target of your attack on-hit. Fiends you grapple are automatically taunted by you.

When fighting a fiend, every attack with this weapon taunts on-hit for 1 round (will negates).\
Allied fiends get a +2 bonus to attack against any creature you attack with Demons Grasp for 1 turn.





The gauntlet is a light slash weapon with the attached and CM (grapple) qualities.
