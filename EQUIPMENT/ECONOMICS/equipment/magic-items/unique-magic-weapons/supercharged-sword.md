# Supercharged Sword

## <mark style="color:green;">8,000g (DC 16)</mark>

This unassuming short sword hums with electricity. It is slightly magnetic, almost as if it wants weapons to hit it. Sunder attacks made against this weapon receive a +10 bonus. When sundered, it zaps the sundering creature for 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) zap damage.

The sword comes with the elemental (zap) enchantment baked into it, and can be enchanted again.

The sword can also be used as the spell focus for any spell with the \[zap] tag.
