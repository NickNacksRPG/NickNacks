# Heavy Metal

## <mark style="color:green;">Expensive (4000g)</mark>

This oversized guitar is made almost entirely out of iron with chrome plating. It weighs 50 lbs and is hilariously impractical as an instrument. In order to even properly play the guitar, the wielder must possess at least +1 Str. It has the following special attack.

<mark style="color:green;">Instrumental Destruction</mark> - \
Whack someone with Heavy Metal so hard it breaks and becomes unusable, dealing an additional 2d6 (7) sonic damage. The mana cost of the next technique you use this turn is decreased by your strength score.&#x20;

You must \[mana burn] 1 as a FRA to repair it so it can be played/wielded again.

The guitar functions as a large hammer-esque 2h crush weapon with the meteor swing special attack  and the CM (sunder) quality.
