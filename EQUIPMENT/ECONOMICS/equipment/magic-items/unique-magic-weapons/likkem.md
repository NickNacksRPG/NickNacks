This staff has a smug frog carved into the tip of it. Its eyeballs are wheels with numbers inscribed on them from 0 to 9. Whenever you defeat a creature with a melee attack using this staff, or a spell cast using this staff, the staffs eyes start spinning, stopping when they reach how much damage you overkilled the target. If you did exactly enough damage to defeat the creature and the eyes stop on zero, it plays a frog croaking sound and you gain a luck dice.

By spending a luck dice, you can innately cast [Lucky Star](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/frogg-saran/level-1/lucky-star)

The standard staff is a 1h crush weapon.
