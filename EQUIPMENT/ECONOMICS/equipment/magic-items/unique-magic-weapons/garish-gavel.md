# Garish Gavel

## <mark style="color:green;">4000g (DC 13)</mark>

This hammer is bejeweled all along its head and has a finish to its wooden handle that makes it sparkle. When you strike it against a solid surface, it is exceptionally loud, even with only a light tap. Everyone can't help but look upon he who slams the gavel.

<mark style="color:green;">Special Attack: ORDER</mark> - Must be directed at a solid object instead of a creature. \
Taunt all creatures within 30 ft for 1 round.

The hammer is a 1h crush weapon the one and done and dueling properties.
