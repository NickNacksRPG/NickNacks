# Quaking Hammer

## <mark style="color:green;">Expensive (4,000g)</mark>

This hammer makes the ground shake when it strikes the ground. When a creature disarms you of this weapon, it smashes into the ground at their feet, letting you make a topple attack as an instant action.

<mark style="color:green;">Special Attack: Fissure</mark> - Strike the ground to attack all creatures in a 30 ft line. Compare your attack to every creature's AC in the AoE. If you spend 3 mana, you can make the 30 ft line 15 ft wide.
