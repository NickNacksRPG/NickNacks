# Rusty Sword

## <mark style="color:green;">4,000g (DC 14)</mark>

This curved iron sword looks as though the black iron exterior could peel off at any moment and is covered with patches of rust. It has a -2 penalty to damage. When used to cut down creatures that can bleed, it changes. The iron in the blood repairs the weapon and then some. Each time you successfully strike a foe, the rust fades and the blade sharpens, adding +1 damage, up to 4 times for a total of +2 bonus damage.

The sword is a 2h slash weapon that has the bleed and easily repaired property.
