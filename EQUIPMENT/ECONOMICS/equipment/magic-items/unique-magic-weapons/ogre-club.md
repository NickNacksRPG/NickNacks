# Ogre Club

## <mark style="color:green;">500g (DC 11)</mark>

This club has metal plates at its end, each face inscribed with magic sigils to enhance this heavy weapons power. Unfortunately, ogres' propensity for randomness creates a different definition of power than most. While the you are threatening multiple enemies, you get a +2 bonus to attack, but you decide which enemy you attack randomly among all creatures you threaten.

The club is a 2h crush weapon with bewildering blow special attack and the easily repaired quality.
