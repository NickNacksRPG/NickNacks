# Boring Blade

## <mark style="color:green;">200,000g (DC 25)</mark>

This mundane sword shows its true power only when the user does not use any fancy shmancy techniques with it. If fact, the sword appears to "activate" glowing with power for a minute when using a technique, but counter intuitively, this is how the sword appears when it _d&#x65;_&#x61;ctivates.

As long as you have not used a technique in the last minute, it is treated as though it has _every_ special weapon property seen in the weapon rules page, with the exception of reach and ranged weapon properties. It has conceal, bleed, etc. You can use every special attack that doesn't have a specific weapon requirement.

Boring blade has 3 enchantment slots.

The sword is a light pierce weapon with the chink magnet and the attached property.
