# Nosey Knife

## <mark style="color:green;">4,000g (DC 14)</mark>

This knife makes the wielder feel uneasy, like it knows what its thinking. Whenever you crit a DD creature, the knife randomly chooses a technique the creature knows to memorize, up to your highest tier technique known. While you wield the knife, you also have that technique memorized.

The knife has a will of its own, and will memorize new techniques if you keep critting whether you want it to or not.

The knife is a light pierce weapon with the conceal and chink magnet property.
