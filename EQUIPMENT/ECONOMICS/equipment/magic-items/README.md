# Magic Items

Some magic items have a scaling component to them called <mark style="color:red;">Manathirst</mark>, growing more powerful when in the hands of someone who is more powerful.

<mark style="color:red;">Manathirst</mark> features are unlocked when you have 12 and 22 max mana, typically kicking in at level 5 and 10.
