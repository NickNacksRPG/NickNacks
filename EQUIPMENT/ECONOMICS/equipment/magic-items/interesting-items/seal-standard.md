## <mark style="color:green;">2,000g (DC 12)</mark>

A seal is a vague title given to an item of significance to channel magic power through. For more information see [seals](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/technique-rules/spell-mechanics/casting-components/staff-component).

Seals are typically attuned to a specific type of magic, such as Brazzeria or Pyromancy, allowing you to cast spells of that tree with +1 CL.
