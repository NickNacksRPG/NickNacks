# Teleportation

A teleportation circle is an undertaking that requires a great deal of upkeep to maintain, with skillful mages on call for when things go wrong. Only the most rich and powerful nations have access to a teleportation circle, and only in their capital. The number of teleportation circles in a world typically does no exceed a dozen.

That being said, the process of teleportation between circles is usually an easy, painless and routine task. Teleportation between these circles costs <mark style="color:red;">100g</mark> and typically only takes a few minutes of waiting in line.

Certain restrictions may be in place during times of war and strife preventing teleportation while they last.
