# Mana Donation

By going to specialized facilities, or by going to churches with gilded altars, a creature can donate mana. When you donate, you \[mana burn] an equal amount. A creature can safely donate an amount of mana equal to their (max-1). There are usually safeguards against donating your max mana, but less savory individuals don't mind. Mana burning your max mana gives you a T3 affliction: [Mana Starvation](https://app.gitbook.com/s/EuW2xQOuMIcaalg1YNV3/afflictions/tier-3). This means that most common people are only able to donate 1 mana each day. Children typically do not possess enough mana to safely donate.

Specialized facilities and gilded altars are incredibly expensive, typically costing 100s of thousands of gold to craft. This makes it so facilities for mana donation tend to be rather sparse, only located in sizable settlements with magical and religious influence.

When mana is extracted, it is turned into a mana crystal. Mana crystals are versatile and can change between states of matter, becoming either liquid or solid for ease of storage. Each point of mana can earn 4g in a mana extraction facility. In a church, it earns 5 GBP and food/lodging for the day.

Most religious services happen in the evening after work, so that way people may spend their mana as they wish during the day, and donate it at night if they wish. With large generous populations this can mean that you can amass large quantities of mana rather quickly. Because most people can only donate 1 mana, you can _almost_ 1:1 translate a population of donors to daily mana generation. Not everybody who donates has commoner tier mana, but at the same time, not everybody can always donate! So the 1:1 ratio is generally the go-to method of determining mana generation over time.

Again, not all places have the correct facilities, so this is often available in villages.
