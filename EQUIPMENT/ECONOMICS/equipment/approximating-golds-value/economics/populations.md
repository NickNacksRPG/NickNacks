# Populations

Settlements receive classifications based on population. More populous settlements tend to condense more wealth, have more facilities and are more cosmopolitan. Certain types of services can be expected in larger settlements, but are unheard of in smaller ones.

The settlements of Nack are generally less populous than those in our world, with even the biggest of cities having only hundreds of thousands of people.

Hamlet - <mark style="color:green;"><1,000 people</mark>

Village - <mark style="color:green;">1,000+ people</mark>

City - <mark style="color:green;">10,000+ people</mark>

Metropolis - <mark style="color:green;">100k+ people</mark>

Some general assumptions about the population...

* About 10% of the population is assumed to be over level 0, with a skew towards early levels.
* Most regions have a dominant religion, with at around half the population favoring them. Metropolises break this mold by having more variety, while hamlets tend to have a much higher skew of 1 religion.
