# Businessman

You are one of owners of a large business, or the primary owner of a small business. Choose a specific profession, craft or performance skill that you are proficient in, or that could be reasonably related.&#x20;

You have access to a location that you can perform all of the necessary tasks of your trade. This location counts as masterwork tools for whatever it is. In addition, you make 10% more money when you work here.

You have to return to this business for at least twice each month for upkeep. If you have a method of long distance communication good enough to have lengthy back and forths, such as a good postal system or magic, you can also upkeep as long as you send such messages 1/week. If you don't you are replaced or the business begins to decline.
