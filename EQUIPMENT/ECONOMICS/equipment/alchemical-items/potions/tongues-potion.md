# Tongues Potion

## <mark style="color:green;">Common, DC 20 (800g)</mark>

Tongues potions are made using the saliva of particularly chatty or loud creatures. When consumed, the potion allows you to sound like any creature. However, this drought is missing one final ingredient: The tongue of the creature you wish to sound like. Without this key ingredient, the potion is useless.

Most tongues potions are sold without the final key ingredient, but alchemy stores tend to have a few preserved tongues lying around.

Potions that already sound like a specific creature are incredibly rare and exorbitantly, but more general things like "orc" or "imp" might be available for sale. Depending on the rarity of the tongue in question, price could increase by 10% for something common like orc, or increase by 1,000% with the tongue of a prince.

Roundabout numbers, decide as appropriate for situation. Big rare=big price.
