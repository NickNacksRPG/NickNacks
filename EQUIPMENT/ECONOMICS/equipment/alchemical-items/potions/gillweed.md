# Gillweed

## <mark style="color:green;">Cheap, DC 13 (90g)</mark>

Gillweed is a plant commonly found in swamps at the waters edge.

This potion must be inhaled instead of drank. Doing so is very uncomfortable and staggers the creature for 1 round. The potion allows a creature to breathe underwater as well as air for 8 hours.
