# Healing Potion

## <mark style="color:green;">Common, DC 18 (700g)</mark>

The jizzle when it is not acclimated to a particular creature consumes a vast amount of resources from the creatures body to immediately speed up recovery.

Immediately restores 5 hp.

By increasing the DC by 4, you can double the price and increase its healing by 5. This doubling in price/+4 DC is cumulative (DC 22 for 700g, DC 26 1400g, DC 30 for 2800g etc)

<mark style="color:red;">T3 and above potions are considered rare items due to their high craft DC.</mark>
