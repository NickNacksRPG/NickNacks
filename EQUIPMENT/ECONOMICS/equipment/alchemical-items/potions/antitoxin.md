## <mark style="color:green;">Cheap, DC 10 (20g)</mark>

Anti toxin is a liquid that can be drank or directly applied to wounds as a standard action, depending on the type of poison. When administered it halts the progression of poison for 1 hour. Using multiple antitoxins on the same creature in the same 24 hour period has no effect.
