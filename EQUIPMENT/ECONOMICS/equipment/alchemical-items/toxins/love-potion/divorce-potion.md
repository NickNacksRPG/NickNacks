# Divorce Potion

## <mark style="color:green;">2,600g (DC 30)</mark>

It's so easy to fall in love, but much harder to climb out of it. The divorce potion negates the effects of the love potion. It uses many of the same ingredients but requires organic matter harvested from the creature who the creature is in love with.

The effects of the potion are instant. The creature is fully aware of everything they did while under the effects of the love potion, but views it as they would have from the day just before they drank it.&#x20;

Divorce potions are most commonly administered to fix accidental love potion consumption. Due to the higher DC, they are much less common.
