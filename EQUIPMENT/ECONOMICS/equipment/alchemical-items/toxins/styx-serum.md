# Styx Serum

## <mark style="color:green;">2,400g (DC 27)</mark>

Using a sample of water from the river Styx and some brain matter, you can create a concoction that can wipe a creature's memories of the recent past. It looks a bit foggier than water and tastes like stagnant water.

The Styx serum is incredibly powerful when ingested. It wipes out the memories of the last 24 hours, including drinking the serum.

Particularly important events, such as a first kiss, a loved one dying or an unexpected betrayal cannot be erased completely from the spirit by the Styx serum. Such events are instead interpreted as gut feelings, fated connections, love at first sight or deja vu,
