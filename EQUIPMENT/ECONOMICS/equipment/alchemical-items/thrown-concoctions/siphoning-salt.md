# Siphoning Salt

## <mark style="color:green;">Common, DC 16 (600g)</mark>

Mineral deposits containing salt exposed to powerful magic can sometimes cause the salt to take a blue hue, giving it anti-magic properties. Mages are hesitant to mass produce it for obvious reasons.

When thrown on a spell with a persistent effect, it acts as dispel magic at CL 3.
