# Stink Oil

## <mark style="color:green;">Cheap, DC 11 (50g)</mark>

Like alchemist fire, stink oil only requires common chemicals. It also requires a little bit of dead organic matter. Most alchemists use their own dead skin flakes to save time.

Throw this vial in the space of a creature to cause it to be sickened 2 for one minute (DC 14 fort negates). Creatures with blindsense (scent) take a -2 penalty to their save. Regardless if the creature saves, survival attempts using scent get a +2 bonus until the creature washes up.
