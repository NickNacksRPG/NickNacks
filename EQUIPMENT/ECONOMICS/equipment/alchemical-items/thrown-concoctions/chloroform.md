# Chloroform

## <mark style="color:green;">800g (DC 20)</mark>

Chloroform is mostly a product of a handful of mushrooms and seaweeds, its properties make it useful in a variety of alchemical creations, but the most well known use is its ability to knock creatures out. A handful of spells and plant creatures have adopted use of this "sleep powder" to incapacitate creatures temporarily. Alchemists have figured out how to manufacture chemicals that mimic this, but are significantly less powerful.

Carefully sealed in glass jars, chloroform is used as a projectile weapon. Make a thrown attack against a creature or a melee attack to smash it against them. The creature must make a DC 20 fortitude save or become drowsy and a bit numb. This gives them blurred vision and 5 temp hp. If you critically strike the creature, it lands in their face and the has disadvantage on its save.

By smashing a second glass jar against an already drowsy creature, they are forced to make an additional save. If they fail, they are put to sleep for 1 round.
