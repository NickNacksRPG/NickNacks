# ⚗️ Alchemical Items

Come in several different categories based on their typical use case.

The format includes the items name, the DC to craft it and its cost to purchase.

I put alchemical items into different price brackets. One for relatively minor and commonplace items another for powerful items, and the last for things requiring incredibly rare reagents.&#x20;

Item DC refers to craft DC, which determines the price. The save DC is typically a base amount (or the class DC of the Alchemist class). If you want to purchase items with a higher DC, adjust the price accordingly.

Cheap - DC^2-80. Then rounded up to nearest 10.

Common - 100+(DC+5)^2. Then rounded up to nearest 100

Expensive - 1000+(DC+10)^2. Then round up to nearest 100
