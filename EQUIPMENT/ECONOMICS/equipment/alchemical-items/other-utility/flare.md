# Flare

## <mark style="color:green;">Cheap, DC 12 (70g)</mark>

By mixing fuel with an oxidizer, all you need to make light is a spark.

A flare provides a source of light that doesn't rely on fire, making it an ideal short term light source, or wet adventures. With a quick twist (swift action) to activate the chemical reaction, flares gives off light like a torch (20 ft radius bright) for 30 minutes. Flares are more resilient than torches in that they can be tossed around, even in water, without worry of the light going out.

With such a simple triggering mechanism, flares can easily be attached to trip wires, or have some kind of specific firing mechanism similar to a firearm to activate it while launching it high in the sky, or both (just as examples).
