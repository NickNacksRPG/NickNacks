# Perfume

## <mark style="color:green;">Cheap, DC 13 (90g)</mark>

Perfumes are powerful mixtures of chemicals with distinct and long-lasting scents, made out of a wide variety of substances. Whether or not they are appealing is up to taste however. You can apply a dose of perfume to yourself as a standard action, and it lasts for a few hours, provided you are not drenched in other liquids or other powerful smelling substances.

The first time you roll a persuasion check or deception check to lie against someone, roll serendipity. If you roll 17 or higher, the creature likes the smell, giving you a reroll against them for such checks. Creature's with the scent special quality tend to find most perfumes garish and unpleasant, increasing the DC to 20. Creatures without a sense of spell are unaffected by perfume.

You can only benefit from a specific type of perfume's benefit once per creature, requiring you to spice things up during your next interaction if you want the reroll again.

By succeeding on a monster lore check against a creature, or just asking people who may know such things, you can figure out a type of perfume they enjoy, bypassing the serendipity check entirely.

Can also be flavor texted as a breath spray or something similar.
