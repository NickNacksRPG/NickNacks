They are often lucid of the facts surrounding their demise, and do everything in their power to correct their qualms - after which they must be put to rest.Undead created by outside forces are constantly suffering a cruel fate, forced to live in broken bodies and without a will of their own.

You still can't continue the endless cleave with your normal movement.At level 6, Combat Step is always a free action.After defeating an enemy with a melee attack, you get another Superior Attack that must be used before the end of your turn (doesn't work off-turn).Whenever you defeat another creature past the first in a round, get you an additional Combat Step that can be used as a free action.<br>Your melee attacks ignore damage resistance to single target attacks from <a data-href=\"group\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">group</a> type enemies.<br>\nYour cleave attacks against group enemies always <a data-href=\"Crit\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/attacking/crit.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Crit</a> on hit.Defeating an enemy heals 3 hp.<br>If you Smash Swing while in the air, you may spend all of your remaining movement to <a data-href=\"Fly\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/actions/action-system/movement/fly.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fly</a> in place until the start of your next turn.

On a 6 or higher, the players go first, or a 5 or lower, the enemies go first. On the first round of combat, whichever party went first decides which creature acts first. Then you swap to the other party and they decide who goes. You repeat this process until either every creature has acted, or one side has several creatures that haven't acted. All remaining creatures act on the same turn and then you start back from the top, using the same order as round 1.When initiative is rolled, all <a data-href=\"Buff\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/buff.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Buff</a> effects disappear automatically (unless its duration is longer than 1 minute).

This is not the case in Nick Nacks. The conventional \"surprise round\" is now a normal round in combat.All characters that are surprised lose are DD during the first round, and the surprising party always goes first in initiative. Surprise can be a bit finicky sometimes, making you question if only some characters should be surprised. If that's what your gut tells you, that's how it is.For example, your party's rogue who was hiding in an alley ambushes a group of guardsmen that are harassing the rest of the party. The guard captain notices but his men do not. Captain is not DD, the rest are.What happens when our party starts fighting in the middle of talking?\nIn the event where there are two parties that don't immediately fight, when initiative starts is usually determined by whenever someone takes an aggressive action, such as casting a spell or drawing an arrow. In these cases, where both parties are aware of each other, initiative gets rolled immediately before any actions happen.Certain types of underhanded tactics can get around this, such as using sleight of hand to draw concealed weapons or deception for a sucker punch.

But, in souls games you can go back to the place you died and collect the money again, so maybe.This kind of natural respawn mechanic is a good fit for campaigns where you expect your players to encounter dangerous creatures on the regular and your players don't get too discouraged from losing.

Directly interacting requires doing things like walking into a wall or attacking a creature, upon which the creature rolls a <a data-href=\"Will\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/saving-throws/will.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Will</a> save. A failure indicates the creature will try to run around an obstacle or that they missed a creature.If used to satisfy the conditions of a surrender (such as making a spooky monster), the creatures affected get a will save to negate it. They have +6 on this save if they saw you cast the spell.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["core-rules,-how-to-play/saving-throws/will.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/figment.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753645040848,"modifiedTime":1746957722000,"sourceSize":742,"sourcePath":"Core Rules, How to Play/Tags/Figment.md","exportPath":"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/figment.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":264,"backlinks":["core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/pattern.html","core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/tag.html","techniques/spell-techniques/enthrallment/enthrallment-1/darting-duplicate.html"],"type":"markdown"},"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/fire.html":{"title":"Fire","icon":"","description":"Fire is a <a data-href=\"Damage\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/attacking/damage.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Damage</a> type <a data-href=\"Tag\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/tag.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tag</a>, representing destruction through heat melting metal or cooking flesh.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["core-rules,-how-to-play/attacking/damage.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/tag.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/fire.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753645040850,"modifiedTime":1749880306000,"sourceSize":104,"sourcePath":"Core Rules, How to Play/Tags/Fire.md","exportPath":"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/fire.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":265,"backlinks":["core-rules,-how-to-play/attacking/damage.html","techniques/spell-techniques/prismancy/prismancy-4/rainbow-beam.html","techniques/spell-techniques/prismancy/prismancy-4/sabre-of-light.html","techniques/spell-techniques/prismancy/prismancy-1/brilliant-barrage.html","techniques/spell-techniques/prismancy/prismancy-1/illumination.html","techniques/spell-techniques/prismancy/prismancy-2/shimmering-ray.html","techniques/spell-techniques/prismancy/prismancy-1/lady-of-light.html","techniques/spell-techniques/prismancy/prismancy-2/solar-flash.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-5/meteor-swarm.html","techniques/spell-techniques/prismancy/prismancy-5/zonnestraal.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-2/flame-tempest.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-2/detonate.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-1/blazing-palm.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-1/flame-blade.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-1/flame-foil.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-2/burning-hands.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-1/flame-surge.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-1/self-immolation.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-1/flame-pillar.html","techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy-3/fire-blast.html"],"type":"markdown"},"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/glamer.html":{"title":"Glamer","icon":"","description":"A Glamer changes a subject’s sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or nothing at all.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/glamer.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753645040852,"modifiedTime":1746957745000,"sourceSize":138,"sourcePath":"Core Rules, How to Play/Tags/Glamer.md","exportPath":"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/glamer.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":266,"backlinks":["core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/tag.html","techniques/spell-techniques/enthrallment/enthrallment-2/stunt-double.html","techniques/spell-techniques/enthrallment/enthrallment-1/rapid-wardrobe.html"],"type":"markdown"},"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/holy.html":{"title":"Holy","icon":"","description":"Holy is a <a data-href=\"Damage\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/attacking/damage.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Damage</a> type <a data-href=\"Tag\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/tag.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tag</a>, representing attacks against the soul or convictions, or divinely-sourced retribution.

With large generous populations this can mean that you can amass large quantities of mana rather quickly. Because most people can only donate 1 mana, you can almost 1:1 translate a population of donors to daily mana generation. Not everybody who donates has commoner tier mana, but at the same time, not everybody can always donate!

If a weapon has more than one main category, then that means its category changes based on the way it is used, such as throwing a dagger instead of swinging it.There are ten main categories:And 4 subtypes:<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Exotic Weapon\" data-href=\"Exotic Weapon\" href=\"equipment/weapon-rules/exotic-weapon.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Exotic Weapons</a> do not neatly fit into these categories, and will list how they differ.Weapons come with damage values, attack speed values, and damage types as their core stats, in addition to the categories listed above.<br>All standard weapons deal a physical <a data-href=\"Damage\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/attacking/damage.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Damage</a> type. If a weapon has more than one damage type, you can decide which to use before you make a given attack with it.<br>Damage values and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"AS\" data-href=\"AS\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Attack Speed</a> correlate such that the damage tends to be very similar without any additional abilities or <a data-href=\"STR\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/ability-scores/str.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">STR</a>. The typical offense-oriented damage values and AS are as follows:<br>Weapons with ranged capabilities (thrown or otherwise) will also have a listed range. Ranges come in an X/Y format, with the X range being the accurate range, and the Y taking a -4 penalty, referred to as the <a data-href=\"Range\" href=\"equipment/weapon-rules/range.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Range</a>.<br>Some weapons come with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Technique\" data-href=\"Technique\" href=\"techniques/technique.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Techniques</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Equipment/Weapon Rules/Special Attack\" data-href=\"Equipment/Weapon Rules/Special Attack\" href=\"equipment/weapon-rules/special-attack.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Special Attacks</a>.

As per the <a data-href=\"Mana\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/abbreviations-and-terminology/mana.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mana</a> rules, you cannot sacrifice your own Mana to get another use of a Limited Technique unless otherwise stated.\nSpecial Attacks specifically are also tied to the weapon - If you use the Special Attack, you cannot pass the weapon off to another creature to use it again, and the weapon has its own Recharge timer.<br>Many weapons come with <a data-href=\"Weapon Qualities\" href=\"equipment/weapon-rules/weapon-qualities.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Weapon Qualities</a>.

Unfortunately, many argue that all optional mechanics are neutral tools for difficulty management that do not impact the core gameplay experience. As players and developers, we should focus on creating environments that allow individuals to experience the game in the way they prefer—including doing so without imposing significant changes that undermine the integrity of the core challenge. The goal should be to empower players while respecting both the game’s design and their personal approach to difficulty.In the gaming landscape, the design of difficulty and balance is a necessary part of accessibility for users with handicaps - especially in harder titles. Players that are too old or too new, that have responsibilities that pull them from the game, limited time, or that simply lack the necessary abilities to enjoy a game should have the necessary means to level the playing field.\nThe design of difficulty in games can be broadly categorized into three distinct approaches: numeric, complexity-based, and opt-in mechanics. Numeric difficulty involves straightforward adjustments such as increasing enemy health, damage output, or resource scarcity, making encounters more difficult through quantifiable means. This is the most simple approach, and is used as part of the other approaches - but alone is often only appropriate for games with minimalist mechanics and low skill expression.\nComplexity-based difficulty, on the other hand, will change enemies to act with more intelligence, have more varied abilities and attack patterns, and require players to master the mechanics already present in the game to keep up. This is often the preferred method for any game with strategy or skill expression, but is the most taxing to implement.\nFinally, opt-in mechanics—such as summoning allies, flying, or activating other assistive features—allow players to choose whether to bypass or mitigate certain challenges altogether. While these mechanics are often presented as optional tools for difficulty management, their adoption and integration can fundamentally alter the player’s experience. There's a clear outlier here. There are no limits to what developers can put into their games as \"optional\" mechanics. The flexibility is a double-edged sword, as the implementation can just as easily ruin the experience if there is not an appropriate alternative or less invasive means. For the purposes of this discussion, I will mainly refer to Skyrim, Mario, and Elden Ring.All three methods of designing difficulty can easily interrupt the core gameplay experience when implemented thoughtlessly. In Skyrim, there is very little strategy and skill expression. At best, the player can move out of the range of some enemy attacks and strike back between them, or properly aim an arrow. Beyond that, the game is no different to MMOs such as RuneScape, where the player either engages in a slap fight whose winner is determined entirely by opposing statistics and how much healing is in their inventories, or the player stands out of reach of a melee opponent and attacks them with ranged weapons until they die helplessly.\nSkyrim uses numeric difficulty. Despite being the easiest approach, there are major oversights in its implementation that force players to use specific playstyles or exploits to keep up. For example, a player that wants to use primarily destruction magic will be greatly disappointed on higher difficulties as their entire Magicka bar is depleted defeating a single lesser bandit, and the abysmal regeneration rate and lack of potions will force them to resort to sword fighting or the use of AI exploits and loading zones. As the game progresses, the only way to have enough Magicka to defeat enemies without hours of grinding is through Alchemy-Enchanting exploits that bring the cost of spells to 0, or their damage to arbitrarily high numbers—the latter of which completely defeats the purpose of the numeric difficulty increase.Complexity-based difficulty is the hardest to implement. With the exception of complexity through AI improvements, it requires making more content on top of what should already be an adequate amount of content for lower difficulties. The more mechanics an enemy has, the higher the odds that they will invalidate a certain method of playing the game and require players to do something they are not interested in. For example, if the difficulty is in higher enemy aggression, then any playstyle that relies on large openings is going to suffer disproportionately. If the difficulty is in close-range incapacitation, then melee players will suffer more than ranged ones. Sacrificing some part of the original experience is often inevitable.\nThere are exceptions where the numeric and complexity approaches meet. The speed of a game and the precision of its timings are a good example—Most of the game remains untouched, and a small adjustment in the reaction time necessary to beat the game can be the difficulty a player wants.At the crux of the issue lies difficulty through optional mechanics. These are the most likely to change the experience of a player.\nIn Elden Ring, the variety of abilities in the game ranges from completely impractical to game-trivializing superpowers. Some are very similar to each other, such as two weapons of the same class with similar movesets that have wildly different performance. Most are not at all similar, making the experience when switching from one to the next completely different. Despite this, one could make an argument that the difficulty in the game rises from which strategies the player chooses.\nThe most polarizing optional mechanic is Summoning. This changes the game from single player to Co-Op vs AI, or Co-Op and AI vs AI. Using this, a player can use NPC assistants to make enemies ignore the player, or simply ask a friend to beat the game for them while they watch. The extreme nature of this mechanic has caused heated debate in online communities as to what extent an optional mechanic can be used to manage difficulty before it simply becomes thinly veiled cheating.Cheating in most games is simply breaking the rules to your benefit. In the context of early video games, cheating was specifically programmed into games using \"cheat codes\" that would allow players to break the rules. Later, specialized pieces of hardware such as Action Replay were introduced that are akin to modern hex editors, allowing players to cheat by changing any variable they could find, far beyond what developers willingly included in their games. All of these were widely agreed to be forms of cheating.\nAnd yet, the definition of cheating became more flexible as time passed, even though little changed in what players were capable of.In Super Mario games, there exist powerups that grant the player complete invincibility combined with another powerup that only appear when a player has died in a level multiple times. These are essentially easily accessible god modes that can be used to skip content that is too difficult or boring to play normally, or for any other reason the players see fit.\nThere is no code that needs to be input. There is no need to go out of one's way to obtain these powerups. They aren't even labeled as cheats. They are even included with explicit intent to be used by a portion of the player base—while many cheats in the past were added just for the sake of having cheats (such as with Big Head Mode) or as rewards for completing the game.\nAnd yet, despite the lack of labeling, there is a subtle acknowledgement that using these is different than beating the game \"normally.\" Achievements and collectibles will look different, scores may be altered, and the game otherwise records your use of these items to give your completion of the game an asterisk.The difference between invincibility powerups and other cheats is that invincibility powerups are deliberate additions intended to help players of lower skill or patience complete the game. They are easy, low-effort inclusions that sacrifice a portion of the gameplay for an easier experience, which would sour the experience for players that do not need them. They are still, however, cheats. They break the rules to your benefit.In Skyrim (PC), the player can, at any time, open the console to manipulate the game via console commands. This is more akin to classic cheat codes, where no player would be able to guess what they need to type into the console to cause a specific effect without looking up the codes, but is closer to the power of hex editors in terms of possibilities.\nSkyrim's console blurs the concept of cheating far more than a handicap feature would. Unlike other cheat codes, the use of the console is far more common even among players that do not like cheats for one reason: Skyrim does not function as a game.\nDid the player get stuck in random map geometry? The console allows them to teleport out. Did a quest break? The console can skip to the next step. Did the game crash? The console can be used to restore progress without needing to replay content.By definition, these are all instances of cheating, yet many would decline to call it such. Cheating has a harsh connotation that someone is cheapening an experience by breaking the rules, and yet this time the cheats are used specifically to improve the experience of a broken game—and arguably play closer to the rules as intended.How do you know what a developer's intentions are? Intuition is a helpful tool, but it is also often wrong. Unless someone spoke their intentions, there cannot be certainty... But we can still make reasonably educated guesses.In Elden Ring, a common argument in favor of using anything the game offers is that, if it's in the game, it's intended to be used. The developers wouldn't have added it if they didn't intend for players to use it. This is obviously a baseless assertion, and there are plenty of examples where this intuitive reasoning falls short.\nSoon after the game's release, there were debates as to whether or not weapons such as Rivers of Blood and summons such as Mimic Tear were so powerful as to be unintended, or even be considered cheating. Players that defended these inclusions used the above argument, only to later find that both of these (and some underlying systems that improved them) were patched to reduce their effectiveness.\nWhich one was truly the intended way of playing the game? Was it before or after the developers changed it? What else will the developers change? Can developers change their intentions?\nSome players that use this argument will make exceptions. For example, some enemies can be coerced into falling off of the map to their deaths, or get stuck such that they are easy targets. These will be exception cases, because their intuition tells them that the developers did not intend for enemies to simply fall off of the map and die on their own.\nAnd yet, despite the developers being able to modify the game however they wish, patches keep going by where these supposedly unintended inclusions remain untouched. When observing the design of the game, it is reasonable to try and guess developer intentions based on conflicting design principles and a charitable interpretation of the intelligence of whoever made it, even without the say of the developers. If in the vast majority of cases a condition is true, except for one specific case where there does not seem to be any reason for the deviation, an argument can be made that the aberration is not intended.\nFor example, in Elden Ring, there are almost always methods to avoid an instance of damage as a player of reasonable reaction time and positioning. Enemy attack patterns will place the attacks in such a way that that is always the case for their target. However, if there are multiple enemies, an attack may be placed in such a way that it is avoidable for the primary target, but not for any others nearby. This can be considered an unintentional side effect of the optional mechanic of multiplayer.In Minecraft (Java Edition), players frequently modify the game using third party programs to drastically alter the gaming experience in ways far outside of the scope of the original game. It would be reasonable to assume that the intentions of the developer do not take into account anything a player may find in the landscape of unofficial changes to the game. Some of these modifications may be considered cheating, while most are considered changing the game entirely such that it is no longer \"truly\" Minecraft. However, there are modifications to the game whose only purpose is to improve the performance of the game, allowing more players the ability to play the game at all. Some modifications fix behaviors and perceived oversights to make the game more consistent.Are these third party changes bringing the experience closer to what was intended? The Minecraft speed-running community certainly thinks that some do. Performance-boosting modifications that do not change the basic rules of the game are allowed and encouraged. It's intuitive that the game running better rather than worse is the intention of the developers. Being able to reset the game more quickly or load faster are generally accepted to not be considered in the realm of cheating due to not affecting the integrity of the performance of the player during their speed-run.There it is—Integrity. There is a sort of principled superiority that cheating is playing the game \"wrong,\" and that accomplishments that were only acquired via cheating are illegitimate. This intuitive understanding is highly attractive, as speaking with someone who claims the same accomplishments as yourself while having a different experience reaching that goal will inevitably cause a disconnect. It can invoke feelings of mockery, as if your efforts are being undermined and cheapened by someone with a GameShark. Cheaters that are perceived to lack integrity are seen as dishonest and insincere.It is no surprise that people will be on the lookout for any examples of something that can be seen as cheating. Whenever there are perceived rules and the perceived breaking of said rules, there will be conflict among players. Developers should keep this aspect of human nature in mind when designing their game, especially if they do not put any effort into explaining their intentions to the players. Players are less inclined to fuss about cheating and accomplishments when difficulty and handicaps are properly communicated to them. When numeric and complexity difficulties are clearly labeled \"Easy,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Hard\" with descriptions of their effects, and opt-in mechanics are properly balanced or labeled as handicaps, players are more likely to be able to have civil discussions about the game's design.At the end of the day, the purpose of games is to have fun. Players will act in accordance with what they find most enjoyable (and accessible), and they will associate with other players that have similar values to their own. Players are also not expected to have the emotional intelligence or logic capacity to put together well-reasoned and compassionate arguments to connect with others that do not think like them. They are expected to complain, pick sides, and attack anyone with opposing views, needlessly causing divides that the developers could have easily avoided.Elden Ring is a gold mine of thoughtless arguments and assumptions from players due to the vague and often half-baked implementation of its core difficulty management mechanics. For this, we will be focusing on the debate around the users of summons against solo/difficulty purists, as both sides suffer from astounding levels of shortsightedness on the subject.Let's start with solo purists that claim that anyone that used summons did not truly \"beat the game\" and that they \"played the game wrong.\" There are legitimate arguments to be made about the poor implementation and incredible variance in effectiveness from the use of summons. Truly, they can be akin to using a Super Leaf in Mario games to skip entire areas and bosses from the sheer power that having another player or ally in a fight can bring. The way enemies do not take into account the presence of additional enemies for their choice of actions reveals a lack of polish or worse. In some cases, enemy AI will simply cease to function when a creature is defeated, or their movements and bodies will become unnatural as they change targets mid-attack, resulting in deceptive and jarring visuals that do not appear as intended behavior.\nHowever, there is no reason to attack others for choices made for the purposes of entertainment in what may as well be a single-player game. Without the developers defining what it means to beat the game, like in Mario, the player's assertions are baseless.As the player progresses further into the game, many of the enemies have identical gameplay with only minor cosmetic differences—and enormously increased statistics. It is not uncommon for a player to fight a generic soldier with a sword and trade hits to defeat them in one blow, only to find the exact same enemy wearing a different color shirt that can kill the player in a single blow. It is entirely possible for a player to simply not have enough ammunition to defeat even a single enemy from differences in numeric difficulty, resulting in certain playstyles being invalidated via arithmetic impossibility. What would normally be a method of difficulty control instead becomes a burden for the player to level up their character to unreasonable strength, skewing the experience unnecessarily because of arbitrary restrictions from the developers.\nFurthermore, the action of increasing one's level has no relation to the core gameplay experience or player skill. If a player wishes to improve their numerical abilities until winning is possible, they will most likely resort to repeatedly resting at a save point and attacking defenseless enemies for an arbitrary amount of time until they have enough points to do so. There is no option to use skill to increase one's ability to deal damage when the resources used to do so are limited - if you have ten shots, and the enemy can survive eleven, no amount of skill will help you win. The increase in \"difficulty\" using numbers serves no purpose except to waste hours of a player's time when players opt for weaker strategies.Strategies and weapons that are stronger or weaker are often touted as the game's main way of adjusting difficulty. In many cases, these are legitimate, non-invasive methods that do not significantly alter the core gameplay experience. If a player likes a specific kind of weapon or spell, chances are there are alternatives that function similarly enough while being substantially more or less effective. It's always easier to reduce effectiveness, as a player can choose not to upgrade a weapon, but it is not always possible to increase the strength of a playstyle past a certain point. That is the point at which this method of difficulty implementation fails. It is a common argument among users of summons that anyone that complains about numeric difficulty while refusing to use opt-in playstyles is trapped in a cage of their own making. This view isn't just false, it's patronizing and misses the valid portion of the purist argument. Summoning, for example, changes the core experience of the game to such a degree that it can and will lead to questions of integrity and legitimacy in a run. Even inexperienced players identify that someone or something else defeating enemies for them \"feels\" like it made their own contributions irrelevant (because it did).That all tools the game offers are equally valid means of managing difficulty is an equivocation. To insist others use them in the same way they would an \"enemy health and damage multiplier\" lacks nuance and borders on dishonesty. To the purists, telling them to \"just summon\" is no different than telling them to \"just play Tetris instead,\" \"just use the Super Leaf,\" or \"have you considered handing the controller to your big brother?\" since, to them, it is either an alternative game experience that doesn't interest them, or actively cheapens the experience of the game akin to cheating, even if the developers did not say such. To them, the game simply lacks the means to make their chosen way of playing the right difficulty, and their way of playing the game for entertainment is just as valid as the summoners.This problem also exists in reverse. For example, what if someone wants to play with their friends, but does not want to make the game too easy? There are numeric ways to make yourself weaker, but the core experience is warped. No amount of self-restriction will make up for the fact that enemies in the game are not designed to act differently in the presence of multiple opponents.There is one last drawback of opt-in mechanics as difficulty, especially in Elden Ring: Not all mechanics are even available from the start. If you want to play the game from start to finish with Godfrey's Axe, you are required to either arrange for another player to drop the item for you, or you need to cheat. That's right: there are playstyles that are not even accessible. The game does not have a reasonable method to enjoy items granted only after beating the game. This is not even for balance reasons either, as items like Fire Giant's braid and Godfrey's Axe are incredibly weak weapons compared to similar ones obtainable earlier in the game. Limited items exist that never respawn or force players to waste time collecting rare resources, which needlessly punishes inexperienced or challenge run players that are more likely to fail when using them. Given everything discussed, using cheats for the purposes of enabling the game to be played in a specific way that does not affect the integrity of the core gameplay is something that should be reasonable to most. The issue is not cheating, it's integrity. There should always be methods of controlling difficulty within a given set of rules while respecting those rules, self-imposed or otherwise. If the developers fail to do so, it is perfectly within reason for players to point it out.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Preamble","level":2,"id":"Preamble_0"},{"heading":"How We Make Things Accessible","level":2,"id":"How_We_Make_Things_Accessible_0"},{"heading":"Attention to Detail","level":2,"id":"Attention_to_Detail_0"},{"heading":"What is Cheating?","level":2,"id":"What_is_Cheating?_0"},{"heading":"Developer Intentions","level":2,"id":"Developer_Intentions_0"},{"heading":"Integrity","level":2,"id":"Integrity_0"},{"heading":"Analyzing Examples of Poor Difficulty Implementation and Arguments","level":2,"id":"Analyzing_Examples_of_Poor_Difficulty_Implementation_and_Arguments_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"game-design-rambling/difficulty-and-integrity.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753645041965,"modifiedTime":1749151749000,"sourceSize":22887,"sourcePath":"Game Design Rambling/Difficulty and Integrity.md","exportPath":"game-design-rambling/difficulty-and-integrity.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":367,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"game-design-rambling/math-and-worldbuilding.html":{"title":"Math and Worldbuilding","icon":"","description":"The Neglect of Mathematics and Game Balance in Tabletop Roleplaying GamesIn all forms of interactive storytelling where numbers are involved, the narratives and imaginations of those involved are grounded in and informed by the underlying mathematics and mechanics. Just like in the real world, math is the basis on which everything exists - change one variable, and the world and the cultures within will look much different. Despite this foundational importance, the math in TTRPGs is often neglected or not taken into consideration during its creation, causing the stories built on it to lack plausibility or the players to engage in degenerate gameplay loops that are better incentivized by the math. We must elevate the standards of game balance and mathematical principles within to ensure a stable play environment with maximal freedom of storytelling.For the purpose of this discussion, I'll mostly be referring to the design of Dungeons and Dragons, but these principles extend to all games, TTRPG or otherwise.Here in the real world, our actions are most often decided by their expected outcomes. People grow the food that produces the most in the local terrain, they wear protection to avoid death, they take the path of least resistance, they outlaw actions that harm others. If the outcomes or goals were different, the actions taken would be different - if stabbing someone was a pleasant experience that extended their lifespan, then the laws around stabbing people would be very different. If we only ate for pleasure, we would grow what tasted the best regardless of climate.&nbsp;This is true down to the very foundations of the universe, where the actions that the atoms and forces of the universe take are decided by simple rules. Light takes the path of least time, mass and energy act towards increased entropy, and other such rules determine how everything else acts.Just like in real life, expected outcomes are what guide us in TTRPGs. If the goal of the player is to live the longest and kill the most things, then the actions they take will be guided by what best gets them to that goal. Because this is based on probability, it becomes a question of simple math to determine the best course of action at a given moment. All else the same, the weapon that does the most damage should be what everybody in the world defaults to. All else the same, the strategy that prevents the most damage taken is the best.&nbsp;Math IS worldbuilding.&nbsp;In real life, we can't fight against monsters and men-at-arms with shuriken and our bare fists. Reality dictates that those actions would likely result in our demise. However, in a game, we often find ourselves roleplaying something that isn't exactly realistic - such as a magician slinging fireballs at ogres. If we want to allow the full range of themes to be represented in a game, we need all of them to be on a fair playing field. There is no purpose to allowing \"Unarmed Strike\" as an action that accomplishes nothing and gets you killed, after all - but we decide the rules of this universe. We can make \"Unarmed Strike\" deal substantial damage, or have additional benefits that make their use reasonable. By setting the rules properly, what is feasible changes to match our desires.Whether what you desire is a good thing is a discussion for another day - let's focus on the hows.What players do is a combination of what they desire, and what the game rewards. Developers should set the rules to reward what they want to happen, and not reward what they don't. Ideally, the incentives should match what the players want to do.The incentive structure of a game like DnD usually comes in the form of power. More money and experience means bigger and more magical swords and fireballs, or more hirelings, etcetera. When you want a fair game for players to enjoy various themes and strategies, you must balance the power such that there is not a single overwhelmingly dominant strategy that is easily recognized by players. This is only fair; if you have multiple players, and one is given obviously inferior power, they may experience frustration or disengagement when they notice their impact on the game is insubstantial as a result.Fairness in a system of mathematics is fundamentally a question of mathematics.When the underlying math is neglected, and the rest of the game is built despite it, you will quickly find oddities. If you make \"Unarmed Strike\" deal 1 damage, and \"Longsword\" deal between 1 and 8, you should not be surprised when nobody will opt for \"Unarmed Strike\" under any circumstances. If there is a dominant strategy, and yet you still declare that most of the people in this world fight with fists instead of swords (all else equal), your world becomes less believable. From the math, the rest of the world-building should come naturally and without significant leaps of logic - If you declare something exists in this world, there should be a basis for it, and this basis almost always comes from the math.Balanced systems inherently foster deeper engagement. Players are more likely to invest their time into the mechanics of a game when they believe they will not be held back by deviating from superior strategies. By employing mathematical approaches to skill scaling, damage output, resource allocation, and character progression, players are free to choose options based on thematics, creativity, and their own desires without worrying about doing the math on behalf of the developers to make sure they are being dealt a fair hand.Everything I've stated so far may seem obvious, and even patronizing, but the reality is that most developers do not take this into consideration as much as they should.I'll spare you the fine details and skip to the important math to keep in mind.&nbsp;In DnD, there are listed weapons that are assumed to be available from character creation. If we consider the world in which this takes place, it would be fair to assume that the people in the world would also want to survive encounters when selecting their weaponry, and those weapons are boiled down to sets of numbers and tags to describe them. The most important number to a commoner with no bonuses to anything is the damage number - in a fight, the odds to succeed are highest by simply using the weapon with the highest damage. And yet, a dagger deals 2.5 damage, while a stick deals 3.5. If they use a very big stick, they can even reach 4.5, if they don't mind using both hands. If they spend some more money and actions, they can use two axes for a whopping 7 damage, and this is only with \"simple\" weapons they may be proficient in.The simple conclusion here is that, all else equal, a commoner's preferred weapon should be a stick, or two axes if they have money to spare. The stick is the most versatile, cheap, and powerful weapon available to them. Even if you take into account the bonuses from stats, a commoner would need maximum dexterity to consider a dagger, even compared to weapons they are not proficient in. In this world, using a dagger is mathematically inferior to every other option for any regular, non-player character.&nbsp;This results in a silly world that only suits the players, without taking into account the rest of the creatures. Why would a knife be a substantially worse weapon than a stick?&nbsp;A goat that attacks a human is likely to kill them in a single attack. How long would a farmer last in such a world?Some classes and builds can easily survive far longer and deal multiple times as much damage as others, often while being better at non-combat activities as well. Why would anyone willingly choose to be the inferior class if the objective is to survive?&nbsp;The expected earnings of a player far outpace the earnings of commoners, as untrained labor is only enough to pay for a gallon of ale or a stay at a poor inn while a single piece of basic equipment can be worth a hundred times as much. Is it really acceptable to put the price on a day of deadly work (such as a mercenary) equal to the price of a dagger, one of the worst items in the game, such that a player could hire dozens of them for every adventure?How long can you ride on a player's goodwill and desire for thematics and roleplay before these poor worldbuilding decisions start to interfere with their fantasy?One of the most insidious phenomena in the world of TTRPGs is the tendency of players to defend poor mathematics and imbalanced mechanics, often born out of a fundamental misunderstanding or intentional ignorance of underlying principles. This defense frequently stems from a place of trust in the developers and an emotional attachment to the game itself, leading players to uphold the perceived authority of the creators.\"If they wanted it that way, they would have made it that way!\"\"You think they didn't think of that? They clearly left it like that for a reason.\" \"Why don't you do better, then?\"When players encounter a system that is hailed as \"official,\" there is a natural inclination to assume that the developers have meticulously crafted every detail, and thus, their choices are unquestionable. Players may erroneously believe that since the developers designed the game, they must have considered every possible variable and outcome, rendering any criticism unwarranted.&nbsp;Players may also propagate the myth of developer infallibility, asserting that they are privy to unique insights that justify design decisions. Such attitudes not only inhibit constructive discourse, but they also diminish the validity of collective player experiences and insights, as an entire community’s lived experiences may be rendered irrelevant in the face of perceived expertise. The belief that there \"can’t be a better way\" is a common claim that started among video game developers, such as at Riot Games and Nexon, as they frequently cite data they claim exists to justify their actions while refusing to release said data to prove it. The truth is that no such data exists, and modern gaming communities can easily get access to or create superior data from which to make decisions.When confronted with suggestions for rebalance, players often leap to the defense of their cherished mechanics, positing that the developers \"must have had a reason\" for their choices. This blind and aggressive defense of the systems further perpetuates the cycle of flawed designs, as those advocating for improvement or merely offering their observations are dismissed as \"Powergamers,\" or told that they're just not focusing on what matters, and that roleplay trumps game design.Because the foundation of these defenses is inherently fallacious, they almost always lead to a statement that reveals their lack of engagement with the topic. The most common ones include that the game is made to be changed from table to table, that the suggestions are merely opinions and do not represent the needs of the community, that the opinions of those that are not part of successful gaming companies are inherently worthless, and basic attacks on the character of those criticizing the game (rather than focusing on the criticisms themselves).Most players lack the mathematical literacy necessary to fully grasp the implications of game mechanics at a detailed level. Consequently, when flaws in balance emerge—be they overpowered abilities, inefficient resource distribution, or underwhelming options—players may misinterpret these issues as subjective preferences rather than objective mathematical failings.&nbsp;The most common misinterpretation of the math is that of percentage reductions: Most players do not know that reducing an effect by 100% is far more than twice as good as reducing it by 50%. A common way this ignorance appears is in video games such as League of Legends, Minecraft, and Skyrim, where players will honestly believe that combining a reduction of 50% with another 50% and getting a result of 75% is somehow a \"diminished\" effect because the total did not reach 100%, when in reality the result is a multiplicative, mathematically accurate, and fair way to represent the effect.Combined with the aforementioned bias towards that which is \"official,\" a majority of the population will convince themselves that their intuitive (incorrect) understanding of the underlying mathematics is also aligned with what the developers think - and, unfortunately, they may be correct.The methods used by the developers of DnD to create the game and the underlying math is transparently dubious. By their own (unwitting) admission, the top-down approaches used by them with a lack of emphasis on mechanics and math, insufficient player testing, and dismissal of community feedback has led to books full of wondrous descriptions of a game that does not accurately match their vision in practice.The examples of such are too numerous to list, but to bring up simultaneous examples that perfectly encapsulate the sheer nescience of the lead developers of DnD, we can look at the playtests of DnD 5.5. During the playtests, the developers made a particularly bizarre public video about the results, falsely claiming that a mechanic that players did not interact with was \"mathematically one of the most powerful\" when it was the worst on average, dismissing feedback because player scores on individual features were higher than the overall score, and even incorrectly referencing their own changes to their own content.&nbsp;What truly happened behind the scenes to cause such a public statement to be made without any proofreading is unclear. It's up to a given individual to review these actions to decide whether it's negligence, ignorance, or deliberate equivocation. I try taking the most charitable approach by assigning ignorance to what could have just as easily been malice.Game developers must adopt a mathematical mindset in their approach. This includes rigorous playtesting with statistical analyses, iterative balancing, and a commitment to utilizing clear metrics for evaluating the effectiveness and fairness of mechanics while maintaining consistency and logic. Checking published content for faults should not be the burden of the players, especially when the product is advertised as being beginner-friendly. Disparities that can be encountered within a new player's first turn should not be tolerated, let alone upheld as intended design.Players should be involved in the balancing process, and even perceived faults in criticism should be thoroughly investigated to identify the underlying reasons for the criticisms being put forth. When a community is particularly large, there's a high likelihood that there will be individuals that practically design the game in its entirety in their criticisms. To dismiss them is the peak of hubris.&nbsp;When a game's fundamentals and mathematical foundations are made airtight, the content built on them will likewise be untouchable. Under ideal circumstances, even inexperienced players should be able to expand on the content in the game with little worry of diminishing the balance. I hope to one day live in a world where criticisms of game balance and mathematics are truly in the realm of the nitpicking and biased, and that all game discussion becomes that of themes and abstractions.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Preamble","level":2,"id":"Preamble_0"},{"heading":"The Value of Balance and Mathematics","level":2,"id":"The_Value_of_Balance_and_Mathematics_0"},{"heading":"1.

The best example of people being forced into the \"game designer\" position (who really shouldn't have been) is this well known issue that it wasn't worth casting healing spells in combat because they healed so little compared to incoming damage. Healers, who also have potent offensive magic, would just let people get to zero HP, then resuscitate them right before their turn with the weakest, lowest commitment healing spell so they both at least get to do some damage before the injured person goes down from the next thing that breathes on them. This was called \"yo-yo healing\" because combat would become a whack-a-mole game of people going down, then up and down again. For some reason, it became really popular to punish going unconscious with debuffs. This is like seeing smoke and trying to fan it away while making the fire underneath worse. Great, now the situation you don't really have the tools to avoid now punishes you further. With such a terrible \"fix\" being so popular, clearly being a game designer isn't an easy, \"anyone can do it\" job. It takes years of experience to get good at it. Most people were unable to identify the root cause of \"yo-yo healing\", which was eventually correctly addressed as low healing output 10 years later by the actual game designers when they buffed healing magic. That being said, the average player, and even modder, likely isn't that great at even identifying WHY something is a problem or why something is causing them to have less fun. After I started playing with KeepInventory, I started feeling dissatisfied after a while of using death as a way to just get back to my spawn. I couldn't just eject the \"forbidden knowledge\" from my head. What I eventually realised is that I DID want death to have some kind of punishment, I just didn't want it to cause \"oh my god, I'm going to lose hours of progress!\" kind of panic.

Humanoids with class levels by default are assumed to have the [unique] tag, unless their class comes with clearly distinguishable features (such as a <a data-href=\"Classes/Fighter/Archetypes/Dark Knight\" href=\"classes/fighter/archetypes/dark-knight.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"iconize-icon-in-link\" title=\"RaEyeball\" aria-label=\"RaEyeball\" data-icon=\"RaEyeball\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"transform: translateY(20%);\"><svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Layer_1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" viewBox=\"0 0 613 613\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 613 613\" xml:space=\"preserve\" fill=\"currentColor\"><path d=\"M450.373,50.909C310.76-29.696,132.239,18.139,51.634,157.751S18.864,475.885,158.477,556.49s318.134,32.77,398.739-106.842\tS589.985,131.514,450.373,50.909z M520.943,430.548c-52.685,91.202-161.687,126.888-243.466,79.7s-105.36-159.371-52.672-250.577\ts161.687-126.888,243.466-79.7S573.63,339.342,520.943,430.548z\"></path><path d=\"M453.038,272.035c-42.94-24.721-100.18-6.026-127.845,41.755c-27.666,47.781-15.283,106.558,27.658,131.279\tc42.94,24.721,100.18,6.026,127.845-41.755S495.978,296.756,453.038,272.035z M371.884,360.58c-19.644,0-35.57-15.92-35.57-35.555\ts15.926-35.555,35.57-35.555s35.57,15.92,35.57,35.555C407.454,344.663,391.528,360.58,371.884,360.58z\"></path></svg></span>Classes/Fighter/Archetypes/Dark Knight</a>'s <a data-href=\"Evil Eye\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Evil Eye</a>), or they are part of an organization with similar training and abilities (such as a <a data-href=\"Monk\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Monk</a> dojo or city guards).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["core-rules,-how-to-play/saving-throws/+saving-throw.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/hitpoints/+hp.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/abbreviations-and-terminology/ac.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/hitpoints/resistance.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/actions/action-system/free-action.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/abbreviations-and-terminology/dc.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/abbreviations-and-terminology/lv.html#_0","classes/fighter/archetypes/dark-knight.html#_0",".html",".html","skills/knowledge/arcana/arcana.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/monster.html#_0","skills/knowledge/alchemy/alchemy.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/ooze.html#_0","skills/knowledge/astronomy/astronomy.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/abomination.html#_0","skills/knowledge/humanities/humanities.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/humanoid.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/titan.html#_0","skills/knowledge/engineering/engineering.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/construct.html#_0","skills/knowledge/nature/nature.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/plant.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/fey.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/beast.html#_0","skills/knowledge/planes/planes.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/fiend.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/celestial.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/elemental.html#_0","skills/knowledge/religion/religion.html#_0","bestiary/creature-types/undead.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"skills/knowledge/monster-lore.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753645042146,"modifiedTime":1754416702921,"sourceSize":2222,"sourcePath":"Skills/Knowledge/Monster Lore.md","exportPath":"skills/knowledge/monster-lore.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":629,"backlinks":["core-rules,-how-to-play/actions/action-system/free-action.html","skills/knowledge/alchemy/alchemy.html","skills/knowledge/arcana/arcana.html","skills/knowledge/astronomy/astronomy.html","skills/knowledge/engineering/engineering.html","skills/knowledge/humanities/humanities.html","skills/knowledge/knowledge.html","skills/knowledge/nature/nature.html","skills/knowledge/planes/planes.html","skills/knowledge/religion/religion.html","techniques/spell-techniques/enthrallment/enthrallment-2/tongue-twister.html"],"type":"markdown"},"skills/linguistics/encode-or-decode-documents.html":{"title":"Encode or Decode Documents","icon":"","description":"Using <a data-href=\"Linguistics\" href=\"skills/linguistics/linguistics.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Linguistics</a>, you can write things in ways that are difficult to interpret without a cipher, such as disguising your forbidden ritual as a cookbook.

Nacks is my very own fantasy tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG). My biggest sources of inspiration are Pathfinder 1e and Divinity Original Sin 2.Most of the rules in Nick Nacks are centered around combat. I expect you to be traveling through dangerous wilderness, delving into dungeons and stealing treasure from dragons. Some rules, such as skills and mini games, allow you to resolve actions outside of combat, like chases and drinking contests.Where I think Nick Nacks shines is its customization options for players and DMs alike. Instead of having traditional spell lists, I made techniques for both martials and mages, each with their own group loosely centered around a theme such as pyromancy, unarmed fighting or necromancy.I have plans to make far, far more classes, subclasses, bestiary creatures, feats and more!","aliases":["Mission Statement"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"What is Nick Nacks?","level":1,"id":"What_is_Nick_Nacks?_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"index.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753645032573,"modifiedTime":1754161188485,"sourceSize":901,"sourcePath":"Index.md","exportPath":"index.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":856,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"placeholder.html":{"title":"Placeholder","icon":"","description":"This section needs to be complete.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"placeholder.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753645032576,"modifiedTime":1750322297000,"sourceSize":34,"sourcePath":"Placeholder.md","exportPath":"placeholder.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":678,"backlinks":["classes/fighter/archetypes/dark-knight.html","techniques/spell-techniques/enthrallment/enthrallment-2/confide.html"],"type":"markdown"},"test.html":{"title":"TEST","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"test.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753645032578,"modifiedTime":1754326943114,"sourceSize":48,"sourcePath":"TEST.md","exportPath":"test.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":858,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"boons/banes.html":{"title":"Banes","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"boons/banes.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753807454901,"modifiedTime":1753807454901,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Boons/Banes.md","exportPath":"boons/banes.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":27,"backlinks":["classes/+class-details/progression-outside-of-class.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/+class-details/achievements/+achievement.html":{"title":"+Achievement","icon":"<span class=\"cm-iconize-icon\" aria-label=\"LiAnchor\" data-icon=\"LiAnchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: inline-flex; transform: translateY(13%);\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide-anchor\"><path d=\"M12 22V8\"></path><path d=\"M5 12H2a10 10 0 0 0 20 0h-3\"></path><circle cx=\"12\" cy=\"5\" r=\"3\"></circle></svg></span>","description":"Achievements are archetypal tasks that provide some kind of tangible benefit after completion.

This section should help provide guidelines for not only the types of things you should be thinking about studying for your alchemist, but also the power of the mechanical effects.In general, majors can be separated into a few categories.The main thing that you should be focusing on for your major is thinking about a completely unique thing that your character specializes in. It should be specific and limited in scope.Idea Phase:\n\"I specialize in transforming into animals\" is a bit too vague and is too similar to the shapeshifter class. If we are on the cutting edge of new techniques, we want something that isn't just another class's features.\"I specialize in grafting beast parts to people\" is more specific, and falls more closely in line with what you imagine a fantasy scientist would do. For me at least, it's easy to imagine Frankenstein's monster type alchemist that has slowly replaced his body with more optimal animal parts to become a completely unique creature.Mechanics Phase:\nSticking with the idea of grafting animal parts, this idea lends itself well to an enhancer type play style. You might gather the parts during your adventures by purchasing them or killing the beasts yourself, but gaining benefits requires work you do ahead of time.Crafting rules are elsewhere, where you can find how long it takes, how much it cost and how difficult it should be. Right now we are concerned with the mechanics. What should a grafted part do? Considering you are fusing parts onto yourself you could give yourself noteworthy parts from other animals to gain permanent abilities: Dog nose for scent, bull horns for a natural attack, fins and gills for aquatic adventures. Considering you're replacing your humanoid parts, there might also be some drawbacks. Lion claws aren't the best for grasping things like opposable thumbs are, for example.An ability like this can open up opportunities for limitless power as long as you keep pouring resources into it, so it should also have some hard limitation. Limiting yourself to only mixing and matching 3 parts for example. Considering the mechanical effect is similar, perhaps use shapeshifter's point system as a basis for how powerful the individual parts can be.Thesis marks the point where few have developed their research to this point. This should be the point where you start bending rules and creating increasingly ridiculous items with your craft.Continuing with the idea of grafting animal parts, this is where you might add a second tier to your crafting. No longer are you just replacing parts, but you can add completely new ones, doing things like turning people into centaurs of all kinds of creatures, giving yourself an additional limb, maybe an extra beast head.Up the limit of how many parts you can give a creature, so long as they are willing to accept tier 2 augmentations.Grand discovery marks the point where only the best, brightest and most insane push their research to the boundaries of what should be possible. This is the point where you should be breaking rules and doing things once only thought imaginary.By combining different animal parts from dead creatures, you can create entirely new creatures. You can make alterations to yourself to make you completely unrecognizable from when you began. Once upon a time you were a man. Now you are a massive spider from the waist down allowing you to climb any surface with ease, your torso is covered in thick chitin to protect your vitals, your head is covered in beady eyes to allow you to see in all directions.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Major","level":1,"id":"Major_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Major</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Major</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">6 - Thesis</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">6_-_Thesis</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">11 - Grand Discovery</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">11_-_Grand_Discovery</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"classes/alchemist/major/alchemist-majors.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273564,"modifiedTime":1754426708238,"sourceSize":4895,"sourcePath":"Classes/alchemist/Major/Alchemist Majors.md","exportPath":"classes/alchemist/major/alchemist-majors.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":45,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/alchemist/major/boomkin.html":{"title":"boomkin","icon":"","description":"You have created a fragile companion meant to run in, tank some hits, and go out in a blaze of glory.

Bards excel when in the middle of their team jamming away to buff their allies and bother their enemies. They also excel at manipulating others, some through clever wordplay or song, and others through magic.{% tabs %}\n{% tab title=\"Art\" %}\nArt by {% endtab %}{% tab title=\"Basic Stats\" %}\nRequires Archetype{% endtab %}\n{% endtabs %}You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.\nThese technique points can be used on the shroomlette, moogen or shira trees.Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips.You get proficiency in the profession (musician) skill and a +4 bonus to all related checks. You can use this profession skill to make history checks. When you make a history check using profession, you need to spend 1 minute to sing the song while playing an instrument to jog your memory.You can make these checks and generate music without an instrument by making the required movements, but you take a -4 penalty. Doing so always takes at least one hand to perform.You can use instruments as the staff component to your spell casting, but you cannot use imaginary instruments.With a week of downtime, you can create a new song and spread it across the land. The take away of a song can usually boil down to into a single phrase such as \"the forest houses a dangerous witch\" or \"Ragnar the Red has been slain.\" Most messages tend to catch on quickly, unless they directly oppose common sentiments or are outright lies: The aforementioned examples wouldn’t work well if the witch is friendly or Ragnar is still kicking.The overall effect of the song is to affect the general sentiment towards specific topics or to diffuse basic information. For example, you could spread heroic tales of your adventure to let people know a deadly beast is dead. A dangerous cult could be lurking in a city and you warn the people to avoid people with a specific symbol on them.When you replace songs using your companion slots, they might not be the talk of the town anymore, being regularly performed on the streets, but they might not be forgotten. If you do a large scale organized event in the area where your song is a hit, you can make one last perform check to see if it sticks for good. See below for DCs.The distance this song spreads is dependent on your level.As a swift action, play an instrument to start a performance for 1 minute. After the minute passes or after using a finale, you cannot activate bardic performance again for 1 minute.Performances affect all creatures within 30 ft of you, specifying either allies or enemies. You can change the type of performance that you're doing as a swift action. A creature that steps within the radius of a performance, gains its benefit/penalties for one round, even if it only exists in it briefly.As a standard action, you can immediately end your performance to perform some kind of powerful action called a finale. Any allies that are within the area of your bardic performance before you perform your finale still gain its benefit for that round.The types of performances and finales a bard has is based on archetype.When you succeed on a save against a charm effect, the creature who inflicted it is charmed by you for the effects usual duration.By burning 1 mana as an immediate action, you can allow a creature within 30 ft to add d4 to a d20 roll (minus luck checks).\n@6 increase to d6\n@11 increase to d8As a swift action, increase the effectiveness of bardic performance for 1 round.\nIf it targets allies, double the numerical bonuses of a bardic performance.\nIf it targets enemies, increase the DC by 2.Usable once per performance.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Bard","level":1,"id":"Bard_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Technique Specialization (Magical)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Technique_Specialization_(Magical)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Magic Musician (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Magic_Musician_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Greatest Hits [companion]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Greatest_Hits_\\[companion]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Bardic Performance (Su) [recharge]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Bardic_Performance_(Su)_\\[recharge]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Countercharm [charm]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Countercharm_\\[charm]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Inspiration [mana burn]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Inspiration_\\[mana_burn]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">6 - High Note</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">6_-_High_Note</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"classes/bard/readme.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273585,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":5159,"sourcePath":"Classes/bard/README.md","exportPath":"classes/bard/readme.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":64,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/beast-trainer/archetypes/magical-beasts.html":{"title":"Magical Beasts","icon":"<span class=\"cm-iconize-icon\" aria-label=\"RaFairyWand\" data-icon=\"RaFairyWand\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: inline-flex; transform: translateY(13%);\"><svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Layer_1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" viewBox=\"0 0 613 613\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 613 613\" xml:space=\"preserve\" fill=\"currentColor\"><path d=\"M494.95,189.116l55.76-126.338l-126.339,55.76L321.447,26.467l13.992,137.385l-119.37,69.434l103.26,22.297\tc-10.147,9.291-20.781,20.039-31.733,30.99v0.002L11.009,560.048v39.072h54.216l269.411-265.5\tc9.827-9.828,18.476-18.918,25.889-27.326l19.677,91.124l69.434-119.37l137.385,13.992L494.95,189.116z\"></path></svg></span>","description":"<a data-href=\"Classes/Beast Trainer/Beast Trainer\" href=\"classes/beast-trainer/beast-trainer.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"iconize-icon-in-link\" title=\"LiAnchor\" aria-label=\"LiAnchor\" data-icon=\"LiAnchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"transform: translateY(20%);\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide-anchor\"><path d=\"M12 22V8\"></path><path d=\"M5 12H2a10 10 0 0 0 20 0h-3\"></path><circle cx=\"12\" cy=\"5\" r=\"3\"></circle></svg></span>Classes/Beast Trainer/Beast Trainer</a> <a data-href=\"Archetype\" href=\"classes/+class-details/archetype.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Archetype</a>.Magical Beasts use their casting to enhance their beast companions.

If you want to hover while it is not your turn, it has the [concentration] tag.When you move at least 30 feet on your turn, attacks have 20% miss chance against you until the start of your next turn.

Unlike water and earth, air cannot create structures, nor can it lift enormous quantities of matter. You can manipulate unattended objects weighing up to (10*lvl) lbs, moving them anywhere within range, including into your hands. Like with all bending, it rewards creativity and allows you to do anything gusts of wind could reasonably do, like allowing you to jump as high and far as you can move automatically or slowing the fall of creatures in a 10x10 area.Initiating and maintaining concentration on air bending requires a standard action each turn.You've learned how to utilize gliding technology to allow you to fly. A glider requires 50g of wood and canvas and 8 hours to make. You gain a fly speed equal to your speed while using this glider. If the glider is sundered, you cannot use it to fly. Using a glider requires one hand.Jumping using airbending no longer requires concentration.By spending a standard action to concentrate each turn, you can fly by creating a whirlwind underneath you, even without a glider. You are limited to flying 30 ft high like this. Each round you concentrate to fly like this you also remove all clumsy stacks.You do not provoke AoOs by taking flight. When you fly you take no penalty to speed for flying up at a 45 degree or higher angle and can do so while clumsy. When flying you are capped at clumsy 2. If you take flight while clumsy 3 or higher, it decreases to clumsy 2.When a creature gets clumsy as a result of wind stance, they also take 15 poise damage.When you are flying at least 15 ft higher than a creature, you get +2 attack against them.You can fly without the aid of gliding technology.

If the effect is intangible magic, attempt to dispel it (as though using elemental counter, even if you don’t have it yet).If you start your turn grappled, deal blast damage to all grappling creatures as a free action.When you take the dash or disengage action, you can leave behind a trail of flames.

Creatures within 5 ft of the impact zone have disadvantage on their save. Deal blast damage in a 40 ft radius and set all creatures ablaze (reflex halves damage and negates ablaze). The meteor's AoE sets creatures that walk through it ablaze (reflex negates).You smash the ground violently, and magma pours from the impact, rapidly filling a 20 ft radius around you with magma rapidly. Creatures in the initial area of the spell take blast damage and have lava cling to them (reflex halves dmg and negates lava cling). Creatures that have lava cling to them have -15 speed and take 3d6 (10) fire damage each round at the end of their turns until 1 minute passes, or they are cooled through other means, such as getting wet or taking cold damage.The AoE left behind is difficult terrain, and creatures that move through it have lava cling to them (reflex negates).

A protective bubble forms around it, allowing it to breathe freely underwater for 1 hour.<br>You can use water bending to manipulate any liquids in the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/alchemical-items\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/alchemical-items\" target=\"_self\">alchemical items</a> section as though using the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/alchemy/level-1/catapult\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/alchemy/level-1/catapult\" target=\"_self\">catapult</a> technique, but it deals your blast damage instead of its standard damage.When you use the administer potion action, you can use waterbending to administer it as a swift action. This also makes it so it does not consume the targets immediate action.Completely freeze over a surface in slick ice. Freeze a 10 ft radius, centered on a point. Creatures inside of this radius are knocked down (reflex negates). Moving through an iced space knocks down creatures (reflex negates). You can avoid falling by treating icy spaces as difficult terrain.Creature within 30 ft takes blast damage and is made frosty or entangled (reflex halves dmg and negates status). Athletics to escape entangle as a swift action. 1 fire damage frees the creature automatically.Whenever you use your elemental wave feature, creatures are made clumsy 1 on a failed save.\nWhen you land your elemental blast, creatures are clumsy 1.Remove the mana cost of elemental wave.\nCreatures that fail their save against your elemental wave are pushed away from you or pulled towards you 10 ft (your choosing for all affected creatures).<br>Your water attacks are considered to be of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/athletics/breaking-objects\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/athletics/breaking-objects\" target=\"_self\">adamantine toughness</a> for the purposes of destroying objects.Create a barrier made out of ice with enough water. Creatures cannot see through the wall. You can make this barrier in different shapes. At least one section of the wall must be within reach. Igloo: 10 ft radius dome, complete with door.\nCastle: 5 ft radius wall 10 ft high.\nWall: 10 ft tall, 30 ft wide. Creature can use athletics as a standard action to break through a 5x5 section of a wall (or more for larger creatures). Alternatively an attack that does 10 crush damage or 5 fire damage destroys a 5x5 section of the wall.As a swift action, you can use waterbending to create icy terrain that lasts until the end of your turn, or until the end of your next turn. This can be used to make things like bridges, ramps, stairs or a small barrier to avoid an AoO.<br>You permanently memorize <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/goomshroom/level-3/aqueous-orb\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/goomshroom/level-3/aqueous-orb\" target=\"_self\">aqueous orb</a> without spending memory. If it originates from a body of water, your CL is increased by 2 and the orbs speed increases to 40 ft.You can freeze a defeated creature, giving them stasis permanently. Must take at least 30 fire damage to unfreeze. You can unfreeze them as an instant action if they are within 30 ft.Choose a point on the surface of the water within 60 feet of you. Water within 30 ft rapidly starts to twist and turn toward that point, carrying anything within. Creatures within the area are immediately caught in the whirlpool (fort negates, putting them out of the AoE at nearest point). When the creature is caught, and every round thereafter, they take your blast damage (crush) and are pulled closer to the center in a very random fashion (roll dice to determine which side they end up on). After the second round of being caught, they are completely submerged underwater.Each round a creature can attempt an athletics check as a FRA to escape the whirlpool's area.\nYou are immune to the effects of your own whirlpool.\nAll creatures in the area are made wet.Special: If you use this outside of a body of water, its DC decreases by 2 and its radius decreases to 15 ft.Entomb a creature in ice (reflex reduces effect to frosty). An attack that does 10 crush damage or 5 fire damage destroys the ice and frees the creature. An entombed creature can roll an athletics check as a standard action to escape.By spending 1000g to perform a special ritual, requiring 10 minutes of concentration, you can bless a small vial of water with incredible healing capabilities. You can use this blessed water to bring a creature back from the dead at 1 hp if it died within the last minute. You can innately tell when a creature is too far gone to heal with this.\nYou can only have one vial of this blessed liquid at a time.As a standard action, enter octopus stance for 10 minutes, causing 8 tendrils of water to form around you. As an instant action, you can take a shield action or parry by sacrificing a tentacle.Cause an enormous and powerful wave of water to wash over the world. Form a wave 60 ft wide and 30 ft high that originates from your space and launch it in a direction. It moves 60 feet each round on your turn for 3 rounds before crashing. When the wave passes over a creature, it gets picked up by the wave (fort negates). When it gets picked up and every round after it takes blast damage and is entombed in the wave. A creature can attempt athletics with a -4 penalty as a FRA to escape, getting deposited somewhere near where they were trapped. If a creature is within the wave when it crashes, it takes 50% increased damage and is stunned for 1 round.You can choose to ride the wave if you wish. The wave deals massive damage to structures and carries objects unless they are securely rooted in the ground. All creatures in the area are made wet.Special: If the waves starting point is outside of a body of water, its DC decreases by 2, its height decreases to 15 and its width decreases to 30.Take control of the body of creature within 30 ft of you (assuming a significant portion of its body composition is made of water like humanoids), stunning it for 3 rounds (fort reduces to stagger for 3 rounds). As part of initially using the ability, and each round it is staggered/stunned by this ability as a swift action, you can cause the creature to attack its friends. If the creature is stunned, you can move it up to its speed and make simple attacks or take the charge action. If it is staggered, you can only force it to make a simple attack.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Waterbending Style","level":1,"id":"Waterbending_Style_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 -

You can still cast any of these spells without staff components.Just as a reminder, some of these techniques you won't have access to until certain levels, since firebenders and waterbenders don't unlock the variants to their blasts until levels 5 and 3 respectively.The techniques are listed in order of their level.

You can remove an infection as a free action.This infection can be identified and removed with a medicine check (DC=class DC).You don't just grow mushrooms, you become the mushroom.

Plucking and eating/feeding is a single swift action. You can choose to grow new mushrooms with new powers on the following days, but growing new ones drains the magic from the old ones.\nMushrooms can be preemptively plucked and handed out to allies so they don’t need to be next to you to consume.In addition to spreading your infection, the mushrooms can have the following effects…By touching a surface, you can cause a tiny toadstool to sprout at that location.

For something much larger like a wall or an enormous fallen tree, it can take minutes.This provides sustenance to you, and this limits its usability.

You can teach them a specific creature if you wanted them to find someone or something in specific.If they touch a creature, they can transfer your infection. This is usually only possible against incapacitated, friendly or willing creatures.

As their relationship deepens, so too does their power. Youkai abilities are inspired by Japanese folklore. Your starting spell list is Moogan and ???When you break the first seal, you gain FH 1 while below half hp. When you roll a natural 1, your youkai spirit intervenes, allowing you to reroll it as an immediate action. You can break the first (second and final) seal as an immediate action to activate this reroll ability.When you break the second seal, your FH increases to 2 while below half hp, and you gain FH 1 when at or above half hp. Even when you are deprived actions (such as being staggered, dazed or defeated), your youkai spirit can take any of the actions listed in the below abilities.\nSpirit Siege, Spirit Guide, Spirit GuardianWhen you break the final seal, your FH turns into regeneration, stopped by poison or fire damage. Through you and your youkai spirit acting in tandem, you gain an additional swift action each turn.Numbers indicate level requirements (6 total)As long as you are missing hp or are bleeding, you can use this ability.\n1/rnd you can make a claw attack as though it was a thrown weapon (20/40 range) by digging your claws into your wound and throwing blades of blood at an enemy.Your youkai spirit is always watching over you, even when you do not manifest it. You get a +4 bonus to initiative and perception. You do not take a penalty to perception while sleeping.In combat your spirit actively participates to defend you. You cannot be flanked. Your spirit can possess your body and move with a 30 ft hover speed and automatically spend your standard action to disengage, even if you lack those actions from being stunned for example. When you are defeated, creatures must still beat your AC or poise break you to attack/move you and you can still make reflex saves.When you grapple a creature, your spirit also grabs a piece of their soul, making them fatigued. If you are not poise broken by the start of your next turn, your spirit devours this piece of soul. The creature you grappled becomes drained 1 and you regain (the creature's lvl) HP. A creature can only be affected by spirit snatcher 1/day.\nThe creature remains fatigued for as long as they have the drained condition.You grow a third eye, giving you the ability to innately cast glimpse of truth 1/day.\nAs a swift action, you can fire a laser beam from this eye. Roll a d4 to see what you get, then choose a target. Make an attack roll as though using a thrown weapon (20, 40). It deals 3d6 (10) damage with a random type and bonus effect. You can decide which eye beam you would like to use, but doing so closes your third eye, disabling this ability for 1 minute. You cannot use this ability while blinded or while you have blurred vision.Your youkai spirit plays a much more active role in combat. It is capable of dashing around the battlefield before quickly returning to defend you once again. As a swift action, limited to once each round, you can command your spirit to do one of the following actions. Its attacks don’t suffer your MA penalty.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"👺 Youkai","level":1,"id":"👺_Youkai_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - First Seal: Spirit Guide</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_First_Seal_Spirit_Guide</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">6 - Second Seal: Spirit Cooperation</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">6_-_Second_Seal_Spirit_Cooperation</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">11 - Final Seal: Quickened Spirit</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">11_-_Final_Seal_Quickened_Spirit</mark>_0"},{"heading":"Fiendish Growths","level":3,"id":"Fiendish_Growths_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Blood Claws (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Blood_Claws_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Vigilance</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Vigilance</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Spirit Guardian</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Spirit_Guardian</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Spirit Snatcher (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Spirit_Snatcher_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">8 - Destructive Tendencies</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">8_-_Destructive_Tendencies</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">10 - Spirit Siege</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">10_-_Spirit_Siege</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/youkai.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273642,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":4775,"sourcePath":"Classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/youkai.md","exportPath":"classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/youkai.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":101,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/fiend-shifter/readme.html":{"title":"README","icon":"","description":"A Fiend Shifter is someone who has stolen the secrets to the powers of fiends, slowly letting this power overtake them.

Well here's me doing my best to recreate that experience in a slightly less heavy handed way than BB fighter. The full attacker is the fightiest guy, all about gaining insane amounts of movement speed and then using that speed to gain more actions. Woe to those who dare to stand in your face.If you defeat an enemy and don't have enough speed to reach a new enemy, you can move until you threaten the next closest enemy, unless your speed is 0.Any turn you spend your standard action to make an attack, can make an additional MELEE superior attack a turn by sacrificing 45 speed once per turn.You cannot use techniques or special attacks after full attacking. If you use a special attack or technique during your turn, you cannot full attack.During combat, your speed increases by 15 this level and another 5 every level after. You must always end your movement with an enemy in reach. If you ever end your turn without an enemy in reach for any reason, you become clumsy 1.Each one can be used in place of a superior attack and they all share a global cooldown, only able to be used 1/round.\nYou cannot sacrifice superior attacks gained from baby slayer to use these abilities.<br>5 Steps Ahead (<a data-href=\"elusive\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/elusive.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">elusive</a>) - Prepare for an incoming attack.

Their abilities are centered around mobility to get into a better position to use this attack.Once per round when you land a melee attack against a creature, gain a stack of gathering storm. With two stacks of gathering storm, you can use this special attack. This special attack can be used any number of times in a combat.<br>Your attack whips up a whirlwind, targeting all enemies in a 60 ft line.

This movement doesn't count against your movement each round. Any movement around a creature you target with this ability is also elusive for this turn.You can combine sweeping blade with steel tempest, creating a new unique effect.

This ability must be used in response to the status being inflicted, it cannot be used against a creature that merely happened to be status'd.Creatures hit by steel tempest are dazed for one round (fort reduces to stagger).Steel tempest's line attack increases in width.

They promote treating creatures with mercy whenever possible, and in the most extreme examples, can make death impossible. Their aura is powerful enough that existing near them makes you safer.Gain a 10ft aura in which creatures cannot gain stacks of Doom. Enemies also do not die when defeated in this aura. This aura is suppressed when you are defeated, or activated/deactivated as a free action on your turn.This aura has a distinct, personalized visual component that interferes with stealth.You add your luck as a bonus to all healing effects.You can add luck to a roll an ally makes as an immediate action if they are within your aura of mercy. You still cannot add luck twice (ie you both add luck to the roll).When you use Channel Energy, enemies in range that were aggressors/not acting in self-defense are pacified for 5 rounds (will negates). They get a new save at the end of their turns if you or your allies take aggressive actions versus their allies, and it ends immediately if you or your allies take aggressive actions towards them.If there are no enemies left, initiative ends, and this ability can be extended for up to 10 minutes as long as you try resolving the conflict peacefully.When you use healing touch, creatures get a new save against any lingering effects that would normally give additional saves (such as poison and some fear effects). Does not apply to permanent status like curses or drain.Creatures that touch your aura of mercy receive a blessing for 1 hour. This blessing allows them to exist inside of otherwise hazardous environments without harm. Blessed creatures ignore environmental effects like toxic volcanic gas, thin air at extreme heights, extremes in temperature, the vacuum of space or the pressure/lack of air in underwater environments.This does not make you immune to hazardous weather, such as hail, windstorms, lightning, quicksand etc. Only passive effects that prevent you from existing.When you rest in a settlement of at least 100 people, you can mark one of the doorways, portals, or similar entrance in the place you rested as your Mystic Doorstep.Until you rest again, as long as you are within 10 miles of the place you slept, you can conjure a Mystic Door that links to the Mystic Doorstep for one minute. It is the same size as the entry you marked.It takes one minute to cast. Any creature can take the portal back simply by walking through it, but it is one-way. Once the Mystic Door disappears, so does your Mystic Doorstep.This effect does not require line of sight.As a standard action, touch a creature. On an ally, one harmful spell or supernatural effect immediately ends, unless it is permanent. On an enemy, this functions as Dispel Magic. For cursed items, this allows the safe removal of the item, but requires a caster level check.This has a 10 minute unique cooldown.You recover from all stacks of drain every time you rest, regardless of conditions.As a standard action, you can touch a creature to absorb 1 stack of drain from them and you become drained 1. A creature can only be affected by this once each week.Gain resistance to a non-physical damage type. Allies in your aura also gain this.You can change what you're resistant to by spending 10 minutes adjusting your magic.Your Holy Arrow has its range increased by 10.Creatures you heal with channel energy benefit from dispel (ignoring the cooldown), and can make a simple attack as an instant action.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Explorer","level":1,"id":"Explorer_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Aura of Mercy (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Aura_of_Mercy_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Lucky Break</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Lucky_Break</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Compassion (Su) [mind affecting]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Compassion_(Su)_\\[mind_affecting]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Cure (Su) [healing]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Cure_(Su)_\\[healing]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Endure Elements (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Endure_Elements_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Mystic Door (Su) [teleportation]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Mystic_Door_(Su)_\\[teleportation]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Dispel (Su) [recharge]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Dispel_(Su)_\\[recharge]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">6 - Blessing of Restoration (Su) [healing]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">6_-_Blessing_of_Restoration_(Su)_\\[healing]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">8 - Elemental Protection (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">8_-_Elemental_Protection_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">10 - Angel Ray (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">10_-_Angel_Ray_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">11 - Benediction (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">11_-_Benediction_(Su)</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"classes/healer/explorer.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273666,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":4344,"sourcePath":"Classes/healer/explorer.md","exportPath":"classes/healer/explorer.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":121,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/healer/readme.html":{"title":"README","icon":"<svg class=\"svg-icon lucide-briefcase-medical\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M12 11v4\"></path><path d=\"M14 13h-4\"></path><path d=\"M16 6V4a2 2 0 0 0-2-2h-4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2\"></path><path d=\"M18 6v14\"></path><path d=\"M6 6v14\"></path><rect rx=\"2\" height=\"14\" width=\"20\" y=\"6\" x=\"2\"></rect></svg>","description":"Healers are magicians that combine natural talent, a breadth of experience, and a compassion for life that results in abilities that lift spirits and mend wounds, both literally and metaphorically.

Let your imagination run wild as you mime staircases, simple tools and all kinds of other things into existence at your convenience, and your enemies' inconvenience.A mime has a few routines that require significantly less strain in order to manifest. These specific uses of pantomime do not have the [mana burn] tag, but are more limited in scope. Each use costs 1 mana. You gain the \"build a wall\" practiced routine and another of your choosing at level 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.Build A Wall - You cause a flat 10x10 invisible wall to appear perpendicular to the direction you gesture. A creature cannot pass through it without a successful will save. Once a creature succeeds, all others make the save with advantage. If the initial creature fails, all others have disadvantage until one passes.Omnitool - You can pantomime a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/mundane-items/tools\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/mundane-items/tools\" target=\"_self\">mundane tool</a>, such as a fishing rod, a pick axe or a hammer. It only functions while in your hands, but otherwise functions as expected.\nLasso - You can pantomime rope, tying it around objects and using it as a lasso to hook around distant objects. There is no limit to how long you can make it, but it must be one continuous string. Other creatures can use the rope if they see you pantomiming it.\nBinoculars - You put your hands over your eyes to enhance your vision. You can see distances hundreds of feet away with much greater detail.\nFinger Gun - You can point at someone with your thumb in the air and move your thumb down to touch your index finger to \"fire\" at them. The creature takes 2d8+CL (9+CL) psychic damage (will halves). You can \"upcast\" this ability as though it were a spell, adding an additional d8 (4) of damage per additional mana spent.You can cast spells without verbal components.You can use your pantomiming skills to cause creatures to say things they might not normally say out loud. In neutral and friendly scenarios, you can start a game of charades. Choose one creature in particular to be your victim, then create an elaborate pantomime that causes them to say something in specific (will negates). This could be something silly like \"Colonel Mustard in the library with a candle stick\" or something more nefarious like \"those disgusting green immigrants.\" Pass or fail, when you initiate this goading charade, the game ends as a result of awkwardness or everybody else getting discouraged at your weird pantomime. The response is generally limited to a short sentence.Creatures subject to this ability cannot be subject to it again until you rest. <br>You gain <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-2/silence\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-2/silence\" target=\"_self\">silence</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/arc/level-1/silencing-strike\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/arc/level-1/silencing-strike\" target=\"_self\">silencing strike</a> as innate techniques.\nBy spending 2 mana, you can cast silence as a swift action on yourself.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Mime","level":1,"id":"Mime_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Pantomime (Su) [concentration] [mana burn]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Pantomime_(Su)_\\[concentration]_\\[mana_burn]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Practiced Routines (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Practiced_Routines_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Speechless</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Speechless</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Charades [mind-affecting]</mark> ","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Charades_\\[mind-affecting]</mark>&#x20;_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Silent Theater</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Silent_Theater</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"classes/jester/mime.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273682,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":4033,"sourcePath":"Classes/jester/mime.md","exportPath":"classes/jester/mime.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":130,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/jester/prankster.html":{"title":"prankster","icon":"","description":"Pranksters are the most ridiculous type of jesters. They are capable of doing things people typically might expect from cartoons. Taking your eyes off of them for just a second is a sure fire way to let them get away. They use incredible feats of acrobatics and sleight of hand in order to troll their enemies As a swift action, you can perform a prank. What this entails varies based on what kind of prank you choose. Slipping and Sliding - Pull out your banana peels and oil slicks. Toss one into a creatures space or into an empty space. It persists until cleaned up. The creature you tossed the prank at, and any creatures that later move into this space are knocked down (reflex negates).\nRealistic Replicas - As long as nobody has direct line of sight of you, you can manufacture a dangerous and silly prank. You cover up a door, you hide a switch or you paint a cave into a wall with exceptional speed. A creature must roll perception against your sleight of hand or they don't realize the deception. They are immediately subject to a dirty trick, as though you had poise broken them, and they take 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) damage of an appropriate type.\nLemon Chaser - Throw some fuel on the fire to bring the pain. In this case, the fuel is citrus juice and the fire is an opponent within reach. If the creature is not damaged, this does nothing. If the creature is missing, hp, the creature becomes sickened 1 from the intense pain (fort negates). If they are bleeding, they instead become sickened 2 (fort halves).\nFlower Power [recharge] - You activate a pocket ornament, allowing you to spray an unsuspecting foe. You make a creature within reach wet. Usable 1/combat.While you are trapped inside of a room, or a cage, cell etc, you automatically escape the moment someone doesn't keep an eye on your for at least one full round (or 6 seconds). You can never tell people how because a magician never reveals his secrets.Instead of disguise and deception, you gain proficiency and a +4 bonus with acrobatics and sleight of hand.Gain one each even level. Numbers next to the name are level requirements.As long as your hands are open and you do not wear a shield, you can effectively wield 3 different items at a time, provided each one could normally be used with one hand. You can add an additional item to the mix every even level. You can also choose include random objects on your person, or that you pick up. Creatures cannot take these items from you unless they successfully disarm you.If you are ever stunned or dazed, you stop juggling, and you can choose what items you still hold in hand.As a swift action, you can roll acrobatics to jump directly onto a creature, balancing on their shoulders, back etc (reflex negates).When you jump on and at the start of your turn while you are balancing on a creature, they are made clumsy 1. You can be removed by poise breaking, or anything that forcefully moves you from your position. Any AoE effect that targets you also targets the creature you balance on.Given 3 rounds of setup, you can plan an elaborate ruse. Using mirrors, conveniently camouflaged hidey holes and hidden compartments in boxes, you can appear to make creatures completely disappear. The creature with the highest perception bonus in a group of onlookers rolls perception opposed by your sleight of hand. If you succeed, then the creature you choose can slip away undetected for the next minute. After the minute is up, people catch on, realize it isn't a joke etc and start the search...If they care.Whenever you take damage, you have a 33% chance to disappear from sight in a cloud of smoke, deflating or something equally unusual, rendering you <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-6/invisibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-6/invisibility\" target=\"_self\">invisible</a> until the start of your next turn.I recommend making effects like this a high roll. AKA a 5 or 6 on a d6.Take a deep breath, stick your thumb in your mouth and blow on it as a swift action. Doing so causes your body to expand in delightfully silly ways.\nBelly - Inflate yourself. Just like a balloon. This gives you a 10 ft fly speed as long as you hold your breath and perform no actions other than movement.\nBrain - Big brain time. You gain a +2 bonus to the next intelligence based check you make this round.\nHand - Increase the size of your hand. Your next unarmed strike this turn adds (d6/odd level) damage.\nAssets - Attempt to charm a creature (will negates). They have a +4 bonus on the save if they wouldn't normally be attracted to you due to sexual orientation (or lack thereof for something like a robot). In combat the charmed creature gets a new save every turn. Out of combat the charm lasts 10 minutes, and once it wears off, the creature cannot be charmed again until rest.You gain a special attack.Flatten - Smush a creature against the ground with such force that they are practically rendered two-dimensional. The creature has their speed reduced by 15 and their reach reduced to 5 ft. This lasts until an ally uses the aid action on them, or the creature spends a standard action.\nThe damage of this attack is changed to bludgeoning. It deals your level in additional damage.You can use this special attack on your allies or yourself in order to slip underneath things like doors. You can much more easily hide underneath furniture etc. Allies take no damage from this attack and can exit their smushed state as a swift action.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Prankster","level":1,"id":"Prankster_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Pranked!</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Pranked!</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Uncontainable</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Uncontainable</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Kinesthetic Learner</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Kinesthetic_Learner</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<em><mark style=\"color:green;\">Talents</mark></em>","level":2,"id":"_<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">Talents</mark>__0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Juggling</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Juggling</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Balancing Act</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Balancing_Act</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Make them Disappear!</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Make_them_Disappear!</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Vanishing Act (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Vanishing_Act_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - All Hot Air (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_All_Hot_Air_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Squashed (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Squashed_(Su)</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"classes/jester/prankster.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273683,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":6410,"sourcePath":"Classes/jester/prankster.md","exportPath":"classes/jester/prankster.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":131,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/jester/readme.html":{"title":"README","icon":"","description":"Jesters are masters of misdirection.

If you can personalize the insult to an extent the GM determines it digs deep, the DC is 2 higher.\nDisarm - Roll a disarm attack. In additional to its usual effects, roll base weapon damage, unless a technique already does so.\nTrick - Roll a dirty trick attack. In additional to its usual effects, roll base weapon damage, unless a technique already does so.Roast your enemies, causing them to falter when it matters most. As an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 ft to subtract a d6 to a d20 roll (minus luck checks). At level 6 this increases to d8. At level 10 this improves to d10.This ability can be used once per minute. You can ignore the recharge time and use it again if you [mana burn] 2.Add 1+½ lvl to all skills that you lack proficiency in. You can make checks for all skills as though you were proficient.\nYou also have the unique ability to perform any skill in unconventional (and sometimes nonsensical) ways. This could mean using strange tools, using your feet instead of your hands and adding superfluous steps for added flare.After a minute of scheming with an item in direct contact with you, you can make sure that this item is always there when you need it. This item must be something you can carry and must fit within a 5x5x5ft cube. You can only have one hidden prop at the ready at a time. You procure these items by pulling them out of hidden hatches, around corners or from behind someones ear. If it is a handheld object (like a trumpet or a sword), this requires no action. Anything larger requires a swift action.These items effectively do not exist as long as you have them as hidden props. They cannot be stolen from you and they do not exist in a specific place. They exist wherever it is most convenient for the jester at any given moment, making other creatures unable to interact with them if you believe it inconvenient.If you are killed, the items fall out of your pocket. Nonlethal methods of retrieving these items against the jester's will require charms, curses and the like.There is a secret network of jesters, their assistants and their fans that all work to aid each other. As long as you are in a situation where there are others present but not currently in sight (such as a person in a nearby shop, or guards in the adjacent room), you can give a signal to have them act. Depending on the type of signal, you can have them act differently.Cause a Commotion - The plant will cause a ruckus by shouting, playing music and being obnoxious. At the very least, it will momentarily draw the attention of creatures so you can hide (or something similar).\nVouch For Me - A random member of the crowd cheers for you, or a prison guard tells their coworker to lay off you a bit. This isn't enough to get you out of situations, but will likely give people pause before inflicting any form of harsh judgement.\nOops? - The plant will \"accidentally\" do something, like opening a window in the way of someone chasing you, or unlocking a door for you to let you inside.In order to recharge this ability, you have to return the favor in some way to the person that assisted you after the situation resolves itself. Usually if you remain in the area, they will come to find you.Spend 1 minute familiarizing yourself with an area. You can interact with an environment, including moving things, painting things, destroying things etc. Then as a standard action while nobody is looking, you can cause it to revert back to its original state, sans minor details like you stealing items from a safe, or adding a few innocuous items. You can do this even if you are not present. You can intuitively tell when nobody is looking and you can use this ability.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"🤡 Jester","level":1,"id":"🤡_Jester_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Technique Specialization (Mixed)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Technique_Specialization_(Mixed)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Master of Deception</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Master_of_Deception</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Fight Dirty</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Fight_Dirty</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Cutting Words [recharge]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Cutting_Words_\\[recharge]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Jack of All Trades</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Jack_of_All_Trades</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Hidden Props (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Hidden_Props_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Audience Plant [recharge]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Audience_Plant_\\[recharge]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Status Quo (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Status_Quo_(Su)</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".html","fullURL":"classes/jester/readme.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273685,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":6381,"sourcePath":"Classes/jester/README.md","exportPath":"classes/jester/readme.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":132,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/lunatic/readme.html":{"title":"README","icon":"","description":"Trust in the power of Frogg-Saran.

They come in 2 main variants: pilots and suitors. Pilots are your typical mecha-style characters that hop into a larger robot and steer it around. Suitors have something more form fitting that augments their movement and fighting.{% tabs %}\n{% tab title=\"Art\" %}\nArt by {% endtab %}{% tab title=\"Basic Stats\" %}\nRequires Archetype{% endtab %}\n{% endtabs %}You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.\nThese technique points can be used on the marksman and tree.Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips.Mechanics start off with a specific type of mech, determined by archetype. The variety tends to come from how integrated it is into the mechanics themselves, such as a vehicle they pilot or a suit that augments themselves.This mech can be sundered, lowering the DC of class abilities that are dependent on it by 2.\nWhen you are defeated, this mech becomes unusable and requires repairing. This requires a (30-engineering roll) minutes (minimum 1) and appropriate tools. If you ever lose this mech, you can recreate it in (30-engineering roll) days (minimum 1) and 200g of materials like metals and comfy leather seats.Unless otherwise noted, all class features only function while mounted on mech.Mechs have many powerful abilities that require the mechanic to gather power. This always has some kind of distinct audio and visual quality, such as revving engines, glowing chassis, steam erupting from every nook and cranny etc. You automatically fail stealth checks when charging, and creatures get a +20 bonus to perception to notice you when charging. Rolling initiative resets your charge, requiring you to charge again.{% hint style=\"danger\" %}\nThis mechanic (teehee) is designed to make it so you cannot use charge attacks on turn 1 of combat. Period. You can't use it as a surprise attack, preemptively charge and then enter combat etc. Hopefully this is airtight, but just in case, don't let players do this.\n{% endhint %}Charging is a free action, but you cannot use a charge move in the same turn that you charge. Vise versa is also true; you cannot charge right after using a charge move. This usually makes every odd turn a charge turn, and every even turn a charge attack turn, provided you have the actions and don't spend them doing other things.{% hint style=\"info\" %}\nThe terminology is a bit weird but there is a distinction between the class feature Charge and the general tag [recharge]. These 2 things do not interact. The mechanic has many of both types of abilities and neither interact with each others cool downs.\n{% endhint %}You get engineering as a bonus skill and a +4 bonus to it. Doesn't require mech.Gain 2 augments, one of which uses the charge feature. Augments are customizable features that can give you new abilities, add additional limbs and enhance your physical abilities.Gain an additional augment each even level.Gain point blank master.As a standard action, closely examine an object or creature within 30 ft to get a +4 bonus on knowledge checks related to it. You can choose to also lock onto them (if you're level 2).You can choose a foe within 60 ft of as a swift action to hone in on a foe. Your attacks have seeking and you get a +2 bonus on attack rolls against this foe until you dismisses this ability (free action). You automatically know the position of the creature. You can automatically lock on to a creature you scan, regardless if you succeed on the knowledge check. This ability does not negate cover for the purposes of attacking this foe, but you are still aware of the foe's position until it moves at least 300 ft away from you.You can lock on to only one creature at a time.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Mechanic","level":1,"id":"Mechanic_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Technique Specialization (Martial)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Technique_Specialization_(Martial)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Greatest Creation</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Greatest_Creation</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Charge</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Charge</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Skill</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Skill</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Augment</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Augment</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Feat</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Feat</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Scan</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Scan</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Lock On</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Lock_On</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"classes/mechanic/readme.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273721,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":4643,"sourcePath":"Classes/mechanic/README.md","exportPath":"classes/mechanic/readme.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":157,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/mechanic/suitor.html":{"title":"suitor","icon":"","description":"Suitors wear their mech like it was a fancy suit of armor.Your mech is essentially a piece of full body armor shaped like you that you must enter to operate.

Otherwise it is a very fancy hunk of metal to them.Because your mech is a suit of armor, you can decide what type of armor it mimics (light, medium, heavy), provided you have the required strength.Many offensive suit augments require hands to utilize. Unlike a pilot who can get a more complex control scheme to activate additional limbs, you cannot use extra limbs to control the additional augments.

During this time you can speak to corpses of creatures with intact heads within 5 feet of you, asking 5 questions (in total, not to each creature) before the power fades.The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including languages. Answers are usually brief or cryptic. The corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. The corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.Touch a dead creature to perceive what happened during the last minute it was alive and conscious.Alternatively project your senses through one of the undead you control for 10 up to minutes.

If the ritual fails, you know why, such as the artifact not being of enough significance, the creature being alive etc.You lose access to your body, only viewing the events as though a passenger in your own body, therefore requiring a 3rd party to do the interacting with the spirit. The creature speaks in its own voice, but otherwise moves and interacts with the physical world via your body. Whether or not a spirit is interested in speaking changes drastically from person to person. Some spirits will be happy to be able to speak with loved ones, and others will immediately leave at the sight of a past enemy. A persuasion check is usually in order before the spirit leaves.The spirit is mostly limited to only what they knew in life, and they are still able to fully articulate their thoughts as though they were of sound mind. Little information about the Mortal Realm passes into the Underworld, and less still reaches the ears of the average spirit.As an immediate action when a creature dies within 60 ft of you, you can choose to seal the creatures soul inside of a staff you wield. A tiny spectral cage forms at its tip with a miniature version of the creatures spirit inside. Until the staff is sundered, the cage is opened with sleight of hand, or you cage a new soul, the spirit is trapped inside of your staff.While trapped the spirit remains conscious and can perceive the world around it as it did in life. You can converse with the spirit, and you can silence it if it gets to loud.When you animate dead, you can choose to set its level to 3 and have it not consume a companion slot.

Those afflicted with the child curse can never grow up. They have the minds of someone much older than they appear mixed with an odd assortment of child-like tendencies and interests.Benefit - You are one size category smaller than what is normal for your race. Your apparent age cannot be magically altered, even through [polymorph] effects.Drawback - Whenever you try to appeal to authority to someone unfamiliar with your curse, you take a -2 penalty to any skill checks related. You take a -2 penalty to poise.EmpatheticYou love people. Those afflicted with the empathetic curse consider most people their friends, and find it difficult to treat others harshly, even those on the other side of the battlefield. Woe to he who makes an enemy of an empathetic oracle.Benefit - When you cast a spell or use an ability to restore hitpoints, it heals an additional 3 HP. Whenever you defeat a creature, they instead gain the time out condition. You can cause a creature that is defeated to automatically stabilize and not die as an immediate action.Drawback - You are physically unable to intentionally and knowingly kill living creatures, even when magically compelled to do so. If a creature within 30 feet of you is dying/bleeding out, you must at the very least stabilize them to prevent them from dying, using any actions you have available.Special - In scenarios where compulsively healing people equates to suicide (such as in a warzone) you can ignore the compulsion to save lives.FollowerYou live for someone else. Those afflicted with the follower curse have separation anxiety turned up to 11. Whoever they are bound to is burdened with the undying loyalty of their companion.Benefit - Choose another creature to form a permanent bond with. You can move in tandem with them if you have the movement. You can choose to be the target of a harmful effect targeting your bond as an instant action. If the effect is AoE and would target both of you, you can instead choose to automatically have them pass while you automatically fail. You get a +10 bonus to any skill checks related to your bond (heal checks to stabilize, perception to tell if someone is disguised as them etc). You can innately cast reincarnate (Frogg 2), but only targeting your bond. It also function on them if they are dead.Drawback - If you have not seen your bond for 1 minute, you are shaken 1. If you have not seen your bond for 1 hour, you are shaken 3. If you have not seen your bond for 1 day, you receive the prior penalties and cannot do anything other than search for them unless physically prevented from doing so. In the event you are shown convincing evidence that your bond is dead, you attempt to use resurrection magic to get them back. If that is impossible, you are shaken 3 for one week before you must select a new curse, or a new bond.FreneticCan you quit moving? Those afflicted with the frenetic curse are excellent multitaskers. They’re always pacing around and touching things when they do anything.Benefit - You get +2 init and a +4 bonus to AC when provoking attacks of opportunity. Increase your base speed by 10.Drawback - You must move at least 10 feet every round. You cannot take 20. If you cannot move, you take 3 true damage at the end of your turn.GenerousYou love to give to others. Those afflicted with the generous curse always tip, always take the tab and will gladly buy things for others.Benefit - Any money that you donate to charity or pay with the curses drawback is put into a “good will” fund. At any time you can call upon this fund to have some non magic positive (and somewhat realistic) occurrence to happen of your choosing. For example you could have a pair of horses delivered to you in your hour of need, then subtract the cost of two horses from your fund. If you sell these gifts then your good will fund immediately depletes and goes negative equal to double the gold gained from selling the gifts.Drawback - Whenever you spend gold (not including your good will), you spend an additional 20% more gold to make whoever you’re paying happy. You cannot intentionally and knowingly steal money or possessions from others, or participate in plans to do so.Special - Some scenarios related to this curse are left up to interpretation. If you wanna make a cool heist mission where you're stealing from a tomb then you can realistically make an exception. But if you’re just casting buffs on a rogue while they rob people blind, that’s a no go. Realistic for the benefit just means no milk delivery when cows are extinct. If the player can come up with a creative way to get what they want, then you should give it to them, or increase the cost.HonestYou just can't help but speak the truth. Those afflicted with the honest curse are rarely trusted with secrets. Their honesty is seen as a virtue to many, but it gets them into trouble quite often when they suddenly start getting quiet, or worse, when they run their mouth.Benefit - When you surpass the DC of a sense motive check to detect if someone is lying by 5, they automatically blurt out the truth.Drawback - You cannot knowingly tell a lie. Not even a half-truth. You are compelled to answer questions to the best of your knowledge. The best you can do to not reveal your deepest secrets is to not speak at all.HornyYour mind is often filled with lustful thoughts. Those afflicted with the horny curse often tell dirty jokes and hit on anything with a pulse. Worse yet they tend to have deviant tastes.Benefit - You gain post nut clarity. After nutting/helping someone achieve nut, you may glean information from your intimate bond. You effectively ask a question and receive an answer in three or less words. The subject does not know you gleaned this information.Drawback - Your partner also gets to glean information with the same restrictions. You know what they gleaned.Identity CrisisWho are you? Those afflicted with the identity crisis curse are really good at not being themselves. Thoughtful parents give their lil’ curse bearers unisex names.Benefit - You can assume the form of any playable race with a duration of one hour 1/day. It doesn’t affect your racial features. You cannot choose to look like the other you (see drawback).Drawback - Every monday morning you wake up as a new person, swapping between two different people. In your head you’re still you, but you look completely different. You still stay the same race, but you swap genders, change size and shape, eye color, all the above and more! You take a -5 penalty to any skill check to convince someone that you're still you if they haven't experienced both yous a few times or aren't a close friend, family etc.LonerYou just want to be alone. Those afflicted with the loner curse are physically drained when in the presence of other people, and thrive when left to their own devices. Confrontation is terrible, especially when they have to do the confronting.Benefit - You get a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws when you aren't being threatened and no allies are adjacent to you. When you aren't in the presence of other creatures you get a +2 bonus to skill checks. Something like a familiar, companion creature or a pet can be a reasonable exception.Drawback - You take a -2 penalty to any opposed skill check. You cannot benefit from or provide flanking and assist other bonuses.MuteYou’d love to chat, if only you could. Those afflicted with the mute curse cannot speak, but are much better at developing intimate connections with those you physically interact with.Benefit - You can cast spells while silenced. You learn sign language as a bonus language. You can telepathically communicate via touch. Your communication happens simultaneously to all creatures touched. While in direct contact with someone, you have advantage on skill checks against them.Drawback - Whenever you spend gold (not including your good will), you spend an additional 20% more goObliviousYou have no idea how bad things really are. Those afflicted with the oblivious curse have things fly right over their heads all the time, sometimes to their benefit!Benefit - You get a +4 bonus versus fear effects. You get a +4 bonus to ac and saving throws until you act in combat. These bonuses stack. Whenever making a saving throw out of combat, also add these bonuses.Drawback - You take a -4 penalty on perception and sense motive. You do not gain perception as a skill. You cannot gain perception or sense motive as skills from any source.PossessedYou share your body…Literally! Those afflicted with the possessed curse have another creature's spirit inhabiting their body. Luckily this spirit has a sense of self-preservation, but it does like having some personal space…Your personal space.Benefit - When you are stunned, paralyzed, unconscious or suffering from a similar kind of status effect that prevents you from acting, you can still do anything that only requires the use of a single arm (such as drink potions, swing a one-handed weapon or manipulate an object). You still cannot cast spells while CC’d. You have a speed of 5 feet while suffering from such conditions.Drawback - You only have access to one of your arms. Your off-hand cannot be used to wear a shield, wield a weapon or perform complex tasks that generally require two hands.SPECIAL - The DM and player should consider the creature that is possessing the limb and perhaps during special moments, or while doing something the possessor likes, the spirit concedes control of the limb to its original owner.RetrospectiveYou’re always dwelling on the past. Those afflicted with the retrospective curse constantly reminisce about the great things that happened in their past. By the same token, the negative events that happen to them weigh heavy on their mind for much longer than most.Benefit - You are immune to effects that magically alter your memory. You recall everything you have ever experienced with perfect clarity. You can cast mirror movie (Larella 4) at-will (self only).Drawback - When you are suffering from an affliction, any numeric penalties are doubles. If it does not have a numerical penalty, it takes twice as long, or costs twice as much as normal to cure because the memory of your tragedies are so vivid.RacistYou hate x people. Those afflicted with the racist curse generally have a disdain for creatures that don’t look and talk like them. They channel this distaste into hatred for a few in particular.Benefit - Choose 3 playable races. When in combat against them, increase your speed to 120. You have advantage on any opposed checks against these creatures, so long as such interactions can be considering \"unfriendly.\" (aka, no persuasion or something like it)Drawback - As long as a creature of this race is standing, you must end each of your turns threatening one if you are physically able. You must use all of your actions to harm and impede these creatures. If you can't, then dash to move closer to them.TwinnedYou're like brothers, only closer. Those afflicted with the twinned curse come with a +1. They have 2 heads and share control over the body.Benefit - You have a commoner attached to you that matches your level (see bestiary&gt;humanoids). You have primarily control of your body and your head has no actions of its own, but can still sense normally and speak. This gives you access to 3 more skills, one of which must be profession, and potentially new race features. As an instant action, your other head can shove you 5 ft 1/minute. They can also perform simple interactions such as grabbing things, opening doors etc using this same cooldown.Drawback - You must concede control of your body in order to use these bonus skills/race features. This requires a free action. Your other head can concede control similarly, or you can forcefully take control by making your other head pass a will save 1/minute. You can also shove them.\nWhen your other head is in control it uses its own stat array, skill bonuses, racial features etc. This happens automatically while you are sleeping and the other head isn't, though most loud/physical activities will wake you up.Special - Because this curse requires cooperation, using it to fuse with enemies can be very challenging.

See card results for more details.Fatespinners, oracles and the like tend to draw the ire from the gods for meddling with the future. They each suffer from a unique curse that provides them with unique challenges and benefits. See the curses section for more details.Your mind is plagued by visions of the future. During carefully curated rituals, speaking in tongues, wild highs on psychoactive drugs or delivered in dreams, you receive premonitions about future events. These premonitions generally focus on great tragedies soon to befall subjects that are relevant to you. This could be important people, places of significance, valuable artifacts, ancient evils and other such things.As far as fine mechanics go, the ritual requires at least one hour of uninterrupted concentration. Generally the subject of these premonitions are focused around a specific subject, sometimes of your choosing, sometimes not. The premonitions are not required to give a precise answer.This next part is as much for the DM as it is the player.As an example. You could divine things about the organization causing strife in this city.\n\"Suddenly you are far away in the nation's capital city. You see brief flashes of the decorations of the summer festival, and a dark amorphous blob moving through the streets. You see many silhouettes moving into the kings castle. The only discernible detail you can see from them is an insignia on the hood of their robes. You hear a voice. 'Today is the day the tyrant is killed.' And then the vision transforms into a beautiful oasis filled with winged horses, before quickly fading.\"Some important takeaways…\nYou ALWAYS focus on the event, not the outcome. In order to be a premonition given to presumably change the future, the information must be actionable. (the king is danger!)\nYou ALWAYS know the WHEN of the event, down to the minute. Other details like where and who can be discovered. (its happening during the summer festival!)\nYou ALWAYS receive some kinds of sensory clues. Voices, symbols, colors, smells, temperature must be present. (robed figures with a noticeable insignia, some large black ooze and the voice of someone important)\nYou ALWAYS receive something that you can affect within the prescribed time. Either the vision tells you about something nearby,or the vision also includes similar types of clues for how you might get to these faraway places. (you'd never be able to get there in time…unless you could fly using a pegasus)\nAs for the [recharge] tag. Depending on the pacing of your campaign, your premonitions might reveal information regarding events that are to happen within weeks, months or years. Generally a fate spinner should have a premonition once each major story arc. No matter what though, a fate spinner cannot have premonitions about a new subject before the events of his current premonition transpire.If you or your DM deem this ability too annoying or disruptive for play...gain an extra technique point and then another each odd level.Fatespinners have an innate sense of how far they can push fate before fate pushes back. You gain a pool of 10 luck. Whenever you add luck to a roll, you can choose to add any amount of this luck pool to the roll. You can add this luck after you fail a check, with your GM telling you how much is needed to pass the check.This pool resets to 10 when you rest.You can push your luck, going negative up to 10 points. Whenever you do, you gain a unique affliction.T3 Affliction: Out of Luck - You cannot add luck to your rolls.Cure - Pay homage to the gods to make up for meddling in their affairs. You must do this a number of days equal to your negative luck pool when you gained this affliction. Paying homage can include spending time at a place of worship or assisting leaders of a religion.{% hint style=\"warning\" %}\nNote, because you can no longer add luck to rolls with this affliction, you also cannot use your fated luck pool. This means when you go negative, even if only -1, you cannot then later choose to go even more negative.\n{% endhint %}You can see the silvery thread that floats above a creatures head, connecting them to the heavens above. This thread is loosely connected to other people, locations and objects. Unless a creature is also a fate spinner, you can wrap this thread around your finger without bringing much attention to yourself while within 10 ft of them, tethering you to the creature. While tethered...\nYou can always follow this thread to lead you to this person. The thread is ethereal and ignores physical terrain, leading in a direct line to this creature, causing potential problems when tracking someone in a dense building, underground or on the other side of world.\nWhen in the presence of people, places or objects of significance to the creature, you can see faint threads connecting their tether to them.\nThe tethered creature remembers you very clearly from any previous encounter you had with them after you tethered to them, even events that happened before the tether.\nYou can only tether to a single creature at a time, losing any previous ties if you tether a new creature.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Fate Spinner","level":1,"id":"Fate_Spinner_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - MM: Fortunetelling</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_MM_Fortunetelling</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Cursed</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Cursed</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Oracle's Premonition [recharge]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Oracle's_Premonition_\\[recharge]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Fated</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Fated</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Threads of Fate</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Threads_of_Fate</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".html","fullURL":"classes/psychic/fate-spinner/readme.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273751,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":6469,"sourcePath":"Classes/psychic/fate-spinner/README.md","exportPath":"classes/psychic/fate-spinner/readme.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":175,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/psychic/spy/glass-reflection.html":{"title":"glass-reflection","icon":"","description":"This ability comes online at level 1, and improves at levels 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.By performing a 1 hour ritual using a reflective surface, such as a mirror or a pool of water, you can see and hear remote locations.

Repairing or breaking things, flexing on people and sleight of hand.\nInstinct is related to wisdom, and represents an aspect of yourself that can see the unseen. Things such as gut feelings and hunches.\nIntellect is related to intelligence, and represents an aspect of yourself that knows information. Things such as logic, mathematics and knowledge.\nAs an instant action before you roll a skill check, you can choose to add a d8 to it. If you fail the check, you lose a point of Mental Might.

You always invoke shivers when you want to find something. When you successfully invoke instinct with shivers, you get insight into the type of place whatever it is you are looking for is. You usually must still put clues together in order to narrow it down.Schizophrenia - The world itself speaks to you. You always invoke schizophrenia on objects of great significance. When you successfully invoke schizophrenia, the chosen object speaks to you. The frame of time it does so varies, but it typically only does so for 1 sitting. The object can relay information about creatures that have interacted with it in the past, like a piano of a musician or a sword of an ancient hero. Visualization - Reshape the scene. You always invoke visualization to piece together how something played out based on physical traces left behind. When you successfully invoke visualization, you can re-imagine an event as it happens, with the vague silhouettes of creatures and objects moving in real time to allow you to determine details like size, shape, sequence and direction.Activation - Start your engines. You always invoke activation in order to activate something. This could mean some kind of complex machine you normally couldn't make heads or tails of, how to open a door with no obvious handle or swing open a portcullis from outside of a fort. Activation may require a specific position or suitable tool to get full value.Mirror - Watch how it's done. You always invoke the mirror when you want to copy someone. You can mimic someones ability to quell an animal, speak a language or perform some type of skill. In any case, your mirror neurons can only do their magic if you have witnessed a creature in action within the last 10 minutes. You mimic the degree of success you witnessed, can speak the language for the duration of a conversation and otherwise temporarily mimic some behavior.Encyclopedia - Master of all trivia. You can invoke encyclopedia whenever you wish, and your brain produces random tidbits of information.

You gain a Potential Pool. You can sacrifice money, inventory space and carry weight, gambit slots, spend time, visit places, and place yourself in beneficial situations to add to this pool. The possibilities are nearly limitless. It is intentionally nebulous, and what you do with your money and time is undetermined until you use your Mastermind ability.Once you have a good amount of resources in this pool, you can, as a free action at any time, produce a flashback to a time when you used them to produce an item or outcome in the current situation. For example, if you have a month of time and some gold in the pool, you can recall a time when you took courses in a language that is being spoken in the moment, and retroactively record what your actions were to perfectly tailor them to the situation. As long as the plan is simple, realistic, and easily achieved, you need only spend your resources to cause the event to happen. If it's a bit more complex, such as sneaking items into a location, you can expend resources to try and get it to happen, but may need to roll a skill check to have it be successful; otherwise, you lose any potential that you would have used attempting to succeed at that task.This ability has a cooldown of 5 minutes. Exceptionally cheap or mundane items/plans have no cooldown.Gain a pool of D8 dice (1+1/2 lvl+Int) . These can be used on any physical ability check or skill check, saving throw, or attack roll, even after learning the results of the check to make it succeed retroactively.\nThis ability cannot be used to exceed what would otherwise be the maximum result (such as 28 for d20+8).While wearing any clothes with pockets, your inventory (that isn't exposed to the world) functions as an arcane pocket with 20 extra pounds. If someone thoroughly searches you, you may use Sleight of Hand to conceal the presence of any items on you.Tip: When added to your Potential Pool, you may use Mastermind to retroactively determine that your inventory is empty after a failed attempt to conceal it, after which you must place yourself in a situation to add it back to your Potential Pool. This is the origin of the ability's name.Gain Sleight of Hand as a free skill with a +4 bonus. You can roll sleight of hand instead of deception when feinting creatures.You may use Sleight of Hand in place of a Profession skill of your choice (typically related to illicit or dubiously moral activities, or businesses that tend to facilitate such). This ability counts as having the Profession skill for qualification purposes.When you successfully hit a DD creature, you may use your Cunning Action to cast Dispel Magic on them, targeting a [buff] spell they have on themselves. If you succeed, you steal the buff for its remaining duration. If it was also [concentration], you begin concentrating on it.Immediately gain 10% of your character's current wealth as bonus wealth that appears in your Potential Pool. Upon finding any loot or income in the future, even as a party, you automatically gain 10% of the loot's value added to your pool. Up to GM discretion to determine what counts, to avoid farming wealth with recurrent sales and repurchases.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Mastermind","level":1,"id":"Mastermind_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Mastermind [recharge]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Mastermind_\\[recharge]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Quick Thinking</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Quick_Thinking</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Shrodinger's Pockets (Sp)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Shrodinger's_Pockets_(Sp)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Fast Hands</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Fast_Hands</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Professional Thief</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Professional_Thief</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Power Thief</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Power_Thief</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">6 - Wealth</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">6_-_Wealth</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"classes/rogue/mastermind.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273760,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":3727,"sourcePath":"Classes/rogue/mastermind.md","exportPath":"classes/rogue/mastermind.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":184,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/rogue/ninja.html":{"title":"ninja","icon":"","description":"Ninjas are a special breed of rogues that heavily focus around using a set of supernatural powers that aid them in espionage and misdirection. Their signature ability, shadow clone, makes them able to exist in many places at once, vastly increasing their ability to gather information.Not historically accurate, but its more fun this way C:You can spend a standard action to cause an exact copy of yourself to appear in an adjacent space. A brief cloud of smoke appears to obscure who the real one is (flip a coin to see if you target the one you intend to). If you are hiding when you do this, so is the clone. In most aspects, the creature functions exactly as you do with respect to things like attack, damage, saving throws etc. Whenever they expend a resource, such as mana, a consumable item, or ammunition, it gets expended for you as well, including contributing to the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/#using-multiple-techniques-a-turn\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/#using-multiple-techniques-a-turn\" target=\"_self\">cap on techniques used per turn</a>. The clone gets all of its own actions, it reasons just as well as you do and follows your direct orders, but you have no supernatural ability to communicate with it over long distances.The clone automatically disappears when it fails a saving throw against anything or takes any damage. When the clone dies, or you dismiss it, you instantly gain all of its memories back, as though you had experienced the events yourself. There is no range limit on how far the clone can get from you. If a creature has reason to suspect you aren't the real you, they roll perception vs your class DC or 10+your disguise bonus, whichever is higher.You can have a maximum of 1 shadow clone out at once. When you make a shadow clone, you are still the \"real you\" and the clone is still a fake. Remembering your clone's experiences can be traumatic. If one is killed, roll a DC 9 luck check. On a fail, gain an affliction. You (or the clone itself on mission complete) can cause a clone to safely disappear as a free action.{% hint style=\"warning\" %}\nThis ability is incredibly versatile and has the ability to completely warp the game. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to exploit this ability, but the DM should not be afraid to not let certain things work. For instance, if you share the same resources and then a clone sits in a nearby safe place to spam some kind of mana restoration effect. This is clearly against the spirit of the ability. Don't let it happen.\n{% endhint %}You can start concentrating on this ability as a free action.\nAs long as you only move during your turn and take no other action, you can walk along any flat continuous surface. This can include things that aren't even otherwise solid such as water or lava. It can also include things such as walls or ceilings.You can use this ability for only part of your turn to get to a location, but if you attack, cast a spell etc, then you need be on a surface you would normally be able to stand on or you plummet.<br>While you stand completely still and take no action on your turn, you are affected as per <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-6/invisibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-6/invisibility\" target=\"_self\">invisibility</a> until you do.

This event is harmful and sudden, such as a lightning strike on a clear day, a large creature falling on them from the sky or a brick falling loose from the wall next to them. They take 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) and are clumsy 1 (reflex halves dmg and negates clumsy). The damage type depends on the effect, but the damage can never be something that the target has resistance or immunity to.The DC increases by 2 if you use this ability after the target says something like \"that would never happen\" or \"may the gods strike me down if my cause is not righteous\" or something to that effect.Recharges after 1 minute.If you miss or graze a creature while threatening another creature, you can choose to instead roll a new attack against the second target as an immediate action. If the initial target was DD, so is the secondary target.You can escape manacles, vines, webs, rope, grapples and more using sleight of hand instead of the usual method. If you would normally escape through athletics, then use the athletics DC. If you are grappled, then roll sleight of hand opposed to the grappling creatures reflex save. If there is not predetermined action type for the effect, it is a standard action.You gain advantage on this check while nobody is watching you.\nYou can also use this to assist an ally to escape from these conditions too.When a creature you can see fails a skill check, you can spend 1 mana to \"try it yourself.\" You automatically achieve their result and add your luck to it. If you succeed, you remove the mana burn.Certain places are well known for particular events. Markets have big sales, shady bars have fights, lively inns have parties etc. You can roll an appropriate skill check in order to spark such events. Roll profession to start a fire sale, roll intimidation to goad some drunkards into a scrap or roll perform to get people dancing. This can apply to any number of situations and skill rolls like prison riots, chanting crowds, sea shanties etc.The DC is 20. The effect is usually to stir people up in public places, so without others present, this doesn’t do much. These events are usually temporary only lasting a few minutes.1/day, choose a location, person or item you can see with 60 ft. Whenever an event of significance happens to the thing you chose, such as a creature cracking at your safe, walking into an abandoned building or petting your dog, you can choose to roll serendipity to happen to be in the nearby area to witness it happen. What is considered \"significant\" can have a higher degree of specificity, such as \"an orc pets my dog,\" but it increases the DC.This usually only allows you to attend to things in your nearby area, such as in your city. When you succeed on serendipity, you happen to wake up to use the bathroom, you do a late night milk run or you got a tip in advance. Typically the DC is 10, with circumstances such as distance, specificity, what you are doing when the event happens and how accessible what you chose to keep your eye on can increase the DC, with unfavorable circumstances adding +2, and downright ridiculous ones (like being in a prison after visiting hours) adding +4, up to a maximum of DC 20.Certain physical limitations, such as being unable to keep tabs on something a country away, can make using this ability impossible. You can keep tabs on (1+luck) things at a time.As a free action, end the knockdown condition.By spending 1 hour doing research or practicing, you can become proficient in a particular skill for the rest of the day. Certain skills may require facilities or equipment in order to properly practice (such as a library for knowledge skills, or thieves tools for sleight of hand).You can sell any item, no questions asked, so long as you are in a place you could consider a city. While inside of a city, you can also spend a few hours to figure out the kinds of illegal things that people sell there such as things related to forbidden magic, or human trafficking, and where you can purchase said items.You have enough street cred to trade with such vendors without requiring any checks. If you unearth this operation, such as by telling proper authorities or the public, you lose this street cred. This also happens if an ally you bring does so. Whenever you sell an item, you get 60% of the items value instead of 50% by default.You can spend a daily use of stroke of luck to cause an unattended, loose handheld object within 60 ft to instantly end up in your hands. The way this happens is usually very dramatic and unlikely, changing based on the scenario. A plank in the floor goes loose, catapulting a key towards you when someone steps nearby. A leak springs in your ship next to you, causing the item to spill out.You never need to roll to achieve the desired result.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Rogue Talents","level":1,"id":"Rogue_Talents_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Never Lucky (Su) [recharge]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Never_Lucky_(Su)_\\[recharge]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - All Calculated</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_All_Calculated</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Escape Artistry</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Escape_Artistry</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Watch How It's Done [mana burn]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Watch_How_It's_Done_\\[mana_burn]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Natural Order</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Natural_Order</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Fancy Meeting You Here [recharge]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Fancy_Meeting_You_Here_\\[recharge]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Kip Up</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Kip_Up</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Quick Study [recharge]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Quick_Study_\\[recharge]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Black Market Connections</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Black_Market_Connections</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Fortune Filch</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Fortune_Filch</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"classes/rogue/rogue-talents.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273764,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":5582,"sourcePath":"Classes/rogue/rogue-talents.md","exportPath":"classes/rogue/rogue-talents.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":187,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/rogue/thug.html":{"title":"thug","icon":"","description":"As a free action once per round, use Intimidate to Demoralize.\nIf you use your Cunning Action to Demoralize, it affects all enemies within 30ft.\nYour attacks against shaken creatures get a +4 bonus.

A secret identity usually has a very unusual outfit, and it always covers the face. Changing between your normal and secret identity requires 3 rounds and some privacy, lest the secret is revealed. Only a handful of trusted individuals are privy to the vigilantes true identity.When using your secret identity, you change your mannerisms, voice, clothes and even more dramatic things about your appearance, making you unrecognizable to even your closest friends. Even magic cannot distinguish the two. For example if you are asked about information only told to your true identity, truth detecting magic cannot tell the user of any lies about what you know. Magical attempts to locate your secret identity fail if you are in your true identity etc.If you are defeated or otherwise incapacitated and a creature takes a FRA to reveal you while in your secret identity, they can discover your true identity.

You can essentially write secret messages by touching your finger to any natural object (typically boulders and trees) and writing. Any message written in this way can be erased by a creature that knows druidic with ease.You can speak with beasts as though you shared a common language. They are able to much better articulate their feelings as though they possessed the intellect of a simple humanoid, but their instincts, desires and attitude toward you remain largely the same.You gain the service of a specific animal to aid you on your journey. It grows more powerful as you do. More rules on beast companions in the beast companion section of beast trainer.Its level is 1/3 your level.You cannot be DD unless feinted, stunned, or otherwise completely prevented from taking actions.You can spend a shapeshift charge to get an overall hunch of a creature or terrain by picking up on things others might miss, like sudden changes in the wind, the absence of animal sounds or subtle scents.When used against a creature, you learn whether the creature is interested in taking advantage of you, interested in helping you, or not particularly interested in you. You don't learn about their plans, only their relation to you. If the creature is a beast, you also learn if it is polymorphed.When you use it on a terrain, its mostly focused on your immediate vicinity or a place you plan to go, such as a cave mouth or the front gate of a town. You learn if the place is dangerous, a safe haven, or neutral. You don't learn why it's dangerous, you just get a bad feeling. If the terrain is natural, you automatically see through any illusions in your direct line of sight.{% hint style=\"info\" %}\nThat 'aint natural!\nSomething is \"natural\" when it is on the mortal plan and it isn't made by sentient creatures. Things like towns and dungeons usually aren't natural.\n{% endhint %}When you use shapeshift, you gain 5 temp hp. This increases to 10 temp hp if you use it to true polymorph into a creature.Your form is fluid and ever changing. You no longer have a true form, and everything you transform into is considered your new \"true form.\" This makes it so creatures cannot forcefully end your polymorph effects with things like <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/wildcard/level-2/dispel-magic\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/wildcard/level-2/dispel-magic\" target=\"_self\">dispel magic</a> or <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/brazzeria/level-2/true-form\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/brazzeria/level-2/true-form\" target=\"_self\">true form</a>.You no longer spend charges when using shapeshift as a swift action. You can spend 1 charge to shapeshift as a free action. You can still only shapeshift once a turn.

He is hard to kill, mobile and has an arsenal unlike any other. He is powerful from a range, but his enemies shudder in fear when he is even close due to his ability to swiftly finish any fights he started with glorious displays of power and gore. With a handful of supernatural abilities, firepower and superhuman strength, the Slayer is a force to be reckoned with.{% tabs %}\n{% tab title=\"Art\" %}<img alt=\"\" src=\".html\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 563px; max-width: 100%;\">Artwork from Doom 2016\n{% endtab %}{% tab title=\"Basic Stats\" %}\n| HP (brute) | 20(+12 per level) |\n| ---------- | ----------------- |\n| Poise | 10 |\n| Skills | 2 |\n| Save | Fort |\n| Memory | 1+(1/2 lvl) |\n{% endtab %}\n{% endtabs %}You gain 0 technique points, not usable in any martial tree. You won't need them.\nCharacters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique.Fueled by fiendish rituals or blessed by celestial beings, you gain a pool of energy fueled by carnage. You have a maximum of 5 points of energy. You start each day with 5 points. If an ability costs energy, it is marked appropriately. If no cost is listed, assume it costs 1 point.Energy can be restored in 2 ways.\nDefeat a creature of at least half your level (restores 1 point)\nSuccessfully glory kill a creature of at least half your level (restores 2 points) You add str instead of dex to for all weapons created by Energy (bigger str means bigger gun)\n+10 speed\n+4 bonus to athletics\n+2 attack, increasing to +4 against fiends.\nYou can automatically jump as high and as far as you can move.\nYou are immune to fall damage.\nYou gain the unarmed combatant and point blank master feats.You can sense weakness in your enemies. Whenever a creature you can see is at or below an hp total equal to (9+lvl), you know. When a creature within 30 feet is at this threshold, you can spend an immediate action to dash with incredible speeds to reach it (in a straight line, even if it is airborne [if you can't fly you fall]) and make an unarmed strike against it. On hit it instantly defeats the creature and you heal (3+lvl) hp.If you so choose, though is completely unnecessary, you can brutally and spectacularly execute whatever creature you just targeted with this ability and they die...Horribly (fort negates). Killing a creature in such a way always results in some amazing feat of strength, agility and a disturbing creativity in the Slayer’s brutality.If this threshold happens to be larger than the health pool possessed by the creature, the Slayer can still use this ability even though they have taken no damage, though he does not heal or regain Argent Energy off of them.Using this energy, you can manifest a powerful double barrel shotgun with a creative attachment. Manifesting the gun is the same as the \"swapping gear\" action. Merely holding the gun does not require energy, but each shot requires 1 energy. The weapon stats are as follows…DMG - 2d8 P\nProperties - 2h\nRange - 10 ft (no second increment)<br>\nExperimental Rounds - Shots fire in a 10 ft line, functioning like a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/weapon-rules/exotic-weapons#blunderbuss-2d6-pierce-2h-reload-10-lbs-800g\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/weapon-rules/exotic-weapons#blunderbuss-2d6-pierce-2h-reload-10-lbs-800g\" target=\"_self\">blunderbuss</a>.\nMeat Hook - You can fire a grappling hook at a surface or creature within 30 ft to drag yourself to it as a standard action. If you target a creature, you must make a ranged attack, but when you arrive adjacent to it, you can fire the shotgun or make an unarmed strike against the creature. Meat hook does not require energy.This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest an axe guitar with the following stats…\nDMG - 2d8 S\nProperties - 2h\nShred - Gain proficiency in performance, but only in playing guitar. +4 when using the shredder.\nRiff of Rage - Give all allies within 60 ft +2 attack for 1 round (standard action)\nSpecial Attack: Finale - Declare an attack as a finale. If the attack ends the combat, future finale attacks gain +1 damage permanently. If it does not end the combat, lose 1 damage (minimum 0). A savvy foe can tell how many stacks you have.{% hint style=\"danger\" %}\nFinale only stacks in actual combat, not training. You can never passively gain stacks.\n{% endhint %}As a free action, move 10 feet, even directly into the air. Can be used multiple times to cover great distances.Augment an unarmed strike that staggers the creature on hit (fort negates). If the attack is successful, enemies within 10 feet of the original target automatically take the attacks damage.This ability can be used in tandem with techniques.This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a rifle with the following stats…\nDMG - 2d8 P\nProperties - 2h\nRange - 30 ft (no second increment)\nZoom - As a FRA, make a single shot with 100 ft range and +2 attack.When you fall at least 20 ft, you release a shockwave in a 10 ft radius around you. If you fell at least 50 ft, the shockwave is a 20 ft radius. The effect this has depends on the target and their HP threshold.Against enemy minions, it sets them to your glory kill threshold. If they are already within the glory kill threshold, they are defeated.Against anything else (including allies), it deals 10 poise damage.As a free action during movement, spend 2 energy to throw a supercharged ball of energy that explodes on impact on the ground, affecting all creatures within 10 ft of the space it lands in. You have 3 types of grenades\n[Fire] - Set creatures ablaze (reflex negates).\nFrag - Deal (3d6+lvl) crush damage and poise damage. If this breaks poise, the creature is knocked down (reflex halves damage).\n[Frost] - Put creatures in stasis for 1 round (reflex reduces to frosty for 1 round).This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a hammer with the following stats…\nDMG - 2d8 C\nProperties - 2h, CM (Sunder)\nHorny Jail - As a standard action, automatically bonk a creature within reach to make them not horny for 1 hour.\nHammer Down [recharge] - 1/combat, strike the ground as a standard action to deal your (d6+d6/odd level) crush dmg and make creatures clumsy 2 within 20 ft (fort halves dmg).\nPlunging Attack - If you start your turn above a creature and are not flying/pseudo-flying, you can make a plunging attack. Plunging attack adds 1 damage per 10 feet you fall (max +20 dmg). Plunging attack can also apply to Hammer Down.Weapon attacks gain additional damage equal to their damage dice. Gain this again at level 10\nExamples: 2h weapon @1=2d6, @6=4d6, @11=6d6\nLight Weapon @1=d6, @6=2d6, @11=3d6This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a hand held ballista with the following stats…\nDMG - 2d8 P\nProperties - 2h, Siege Weapon\nRange - 60 ft (no second increment)\nSpecial Attack: GET OVER HERE! - On hit make a drag attack with a +4 bonus. If successful they are pulled adjacent to you\nSiege Mode [recharge] - 1/combat as a FRA charge and release a horizontal slashing energy projectile. Creatures in a 100ft line that is 15 ft wide take (5d8+lvl) slashing damage and start bleeding for 2d8 damage (reflex halves damage and negates bleed).\nYou can reduce the charge time, making this only require a standard action, but the line is only 5 ft wide.This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a sword with the following stats…\nDMG - 2d8 S\nProperties - 2h, Special Attack: Determination\nMelt - As a standard action, cut a hole in a surface of solid or lesser toughness large enough for you to fit through with ease.\nSpecial Attack: Sever - On hit sever an limb from a creature (fort negates).\nArm - Creature is unable to use arm\nLeg - Creatures speed is reduced by 15. Clumsy 1 permanently.\nWing - Creature is unable to fly.Other limbs can be selected, disabling natural attacks like tentacles and such. These are just the most common examples.You gain combat reflexes as a bonus feat.You can use glory kill an instant action by consuming an AoO (essentially 3 times round unless you can AoO more somehow).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"🐇 Slayer","level":1,"id":"🐇_Slayer_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Technique Specialization (Martial)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Technique_Specialization_(Martial)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Energy (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Energy_(Su)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Superhuman</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Superhuman</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Feats</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Feats</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Glory Kill [healing] [overheal] [elusive]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Glory_Kill_\\[healing]_\\[overheal]_\\[elusive]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Energy: Old Friend</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Energy_Old_Friend</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Energy: Shredder</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Energy_Shredder</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Energy: Dash [elusive]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Energy_Dash_\\[elusive]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Energy: Blood Punch</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Energy_Blood_Punch</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">3 - Energy: Heavy Assault</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">3_-_Energy_Heavy_Assault</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">3 - Heavy Impact</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">3_-_Heavy_Impact</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Energy: Grenade</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Energy_Grenade</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">5 - Energy: Hammer</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">5_-_Energy_Hammer</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">6 - Striking</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">6_-_Striking</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">7 - Energy: Ballista</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">7_-_Energy_Ballista</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">9 - Energy: Sword</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">9_-_Energy_Sword</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">10 - Carnage</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">10_-_Carnage</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".html","fullURL":"classes/slayer/readme.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273776,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":10397,"sourcePath":"Classes/slayer/README.md","exportPath":"classes/slayer/readme.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":195,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/slayer/sentinel.html":{"title":"sentinel","icon":"","description":"The Sentinel Slayer trades many of the abilities granted by the original slayer class to pivot the class from an unrelenting aggressor to a more defensive play style.

A unique source means something that is different from the previous ones. For example, your two financial wizard brothers would not be different sources. Those same two brothers and a dragon are 2 sources. 2 brothers, a dragon and a laboratory are 3 sources.Basically there needs to be a variety of sources of inspiration for arcane synergy to function. Each individual can still lend aid, giving a bonus depending on their proficiency. In that same example, your two brothers would collectively give a +6 bonus (2 proficient+2 proficient+2 synergy). The dragon, less versed in magic, lacks the arcana skill and gives a +3 bonus. The lab you are doing research in normally gives +2, but with synergy gives +4.

When you have an alternate persona, you have no \"true\" form.Your alternate persona has all of your abilities and statistics, but you can decide to swap up to 2 of your skills for any others, and your race may be different. If these changes cause you to no longer qualify for a feat or class feature upon assuming the other form, then you lose access as normal.It takes a week of work to fabricate a new form, and a week to \"kill off\" an old form. These personas consume your Companion slots, and you may have more than one if you have enough slots. You start off with one alternate persona.Gain deception and disguise as bonus skills.Upon engaging in conversation with a creature for at least one minute, you can call out one detail of its appearance, recent activities (within a day), or mannerisms as a free action. You instantly learn its mental state and intentions as they relate to the detail, within the scope of the totality of information you have on the creature (will negates).Essentially, you correctly guess why a creature did or is doing something. Part of this ability is speaking your guess to the creature, and judging your accuracy off of its response; if it passes its save, you guess wrong, may look silly, and can no longer use this ability on the same creature until you rest. You may substitute the DC with Insight, and the target may substitute its Will save with Deception.As a free action, name a rumor. You gain a sixth sense for who has heard or spread this rumor. If you see the people they told or heard it from, they appear to glow white or red to you, respectively. If you interact with the creature, you can see a literal trail of ethereal energy to the people they either heard the rumor from, or who they told the rumor.Using this ability again negates the previous use.You can amputate a helpless, willing, or recently deceased (within an hour) playable race's face, and spend 500g and 8 hours of labor to convert it into a Maligner's Mask attuned to that specific creature. Most creatures will die or go blind upon having their face amputated without immediate medical attention.When you wear this mask, you partially transform into that creature, which counts as a disguise and grants a +4 bonus skill checks to appear as that specific creature. Putting it on is a full round action, but removing it is a Swapping Gear action. It does not change your clothes or equipment. Other creatures may wear these masks.While you possess a mask, you can use Faceless Monster to create a persona of a person whose mask you possess. If the persona you steal still lives, or is absent for long periods of time, it can cause problems.You can attempt to spread a rumor throughout a small town or larger settlement by attempting a deception check. The difficulty depends on the size, ranging from 10 for a small town to 30 for a metropolis, though this difficulty may be modified if the population as a whole tends towards skepticism or insanity.It takes a week for a rumor to spread. If you succeed by 5 or more, the time is reduced to 3 days. If you fail by 5 or more, the rumor mutates into a competing theory.Each of your personas may only have one rumor brewing at a time.After a minute of concentration, you can enter a state of calm where you deepen your connection with your collection of masks. You can communicate with the fragments of the persons soul left behind within. The masks appear to speak to you, and you can inquire things about these people as though you were a neutral party. As such, they are usually willing to tell you some things, but hesitant for others, usually requiring skill checks. Once you try and pry into something secret and fail, the information is lost forever. The masks are unable to form new memories, and therefore always treat you as they would a stranger, no matter what you ask.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"🎭 Maligner","level":1,"id":"🎭_Maligner_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Technique Specialization (Magic)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Technique_Specialization_(Magic)</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Faceless Monster (Su) [polymorph, true] [companion]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Faceless_Monster_(Su)_\\[polymorph,_true]_\\[companion]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Skill</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Skill</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">1 - Catechize [language]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">1_-_Catechize_\\[language]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">2 - Rumor Trails (Su) [concentration]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">2_-_Rumor_Trails_(Su)_\\[concentration]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">4 - Face Stealer (Su) [poly, true]</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">4_-_Face_Stealer_(Su)_\\[poly,_true]</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">6 - Rumormonger</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">6_-_Rumormonger</mark>_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">8 - All Friends Here (Su)</mark>","level":2,"id":"<mark_style=\"colorgreen;\">8_-_All_Friends_Here_(Su)</mark>_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".html","fullURL":"classes/maligner.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754331273549,"modifiedTime":1754330275000,"sourceSize":6290,"sourcePath":"Classes/maligner.md","exportPath":"classes/maligner.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":209,"backlinks":["classes-gitbook/summary.html"],"type":"markdown"},"classes/mana-addict.html":{"title":"mana-addict","icon":"","description":"A mana addict is an antimage who is well and truly addicted to the power of mana flowing through them.

You can drop this eulogy off on the corpse, the creature's previous home or simply a nearby settlement. This eulogy naturally multiplies, finding itself in newspaper stands, cafes, waiting rooms etc. The less important the creature, the less it spreads. This results in the eulogy being pretty common knowledge for well known people, and the talk of the town for beloved or reviled creatures.You can choose to write or draw anything on this eulogy, but cannot attach any kind of magical spells/traps to it.

It can be placed on the surface of still(ish) water. It can be used as a bridge to cross a chasm, provided the gap is mostly level.While walking on this carpet, creatures ignore difficult terrain. If you make another carpet, the previous one disappears.You can extend your hand towards a creature and offer to show them the world (or something to that effect). If they willingly take your hand, they are automatically fascinated for up to 5 minutes. During this time you completely obscure their senses from the outside world and take them on a magical journey of your imagining with catchy songs and pretty visuals straight out of a Disney movie.To the outside world it merely looks like you are holding hands with the creature.

How they survived a bloody conflict, went through incredibly rigorous training to become the best and brightest mage, was chosen by god or some other equally astonishing development. Then the game says \"you die in one hit to a goblin.\"While not entirely unrealistic, it doesn't make for very satisfying gameplay to have your character feel like they are made out of paper and are one stray crit away from instant death. A game like DnD 5e remedies this by making KO'd a state your character falls in and out of multiple times as a result of \"le nat 20,\" spammable low action healing and a lack of negative hit points.If you want the player characters to be invincible compared to monsters of a similar level, I say skip the pretense.

There are obviously other factors, but you can't ever keep adventuring without hp. Mana is the general resource system tied to using special abilities, and it naturally recharges when not used.In general healing that keeps you at full HP all the time is intended to be more scarce, and usually come at the cost of reducing your max mana until you rest.In general, only PCs will have this buff.

Ill outline here what a typical class page looks like. Right here I give a brief description of the class.{% tabs %}\n{% tab title=\"Art\" %}\nThis is where I put art I think showcases the class well. I include sources where possible and I draw a lot of it. Click the other tab!\n{% endtab %}{% tab title=\"Basic Stats\" %}\nHere I include a chart that lets you know some of the important stats related to the classes. Each of these stats are described in the rules section.{% endtab %}\n{% endtabs %}Most characters will get their core abilities front-loaded at level 1. All classes get access to some type of techniques, whether its martial techniques or spells. Technique points granted through class usually have some form of restriction.Even levels are mostly dedicated to class features that directly increase the classes power. Access to new combat abilities, increasing the power of old ones, getting their own special attacks. Odd levels are mostly dedicated to getting the next tier of techniques. As such, class features are usually sparse. If any are included, they are usually minor increases in power or they are flavorful inclusions.\nYou also get a feat every odd level.Level 11 is an exception to the odd levels rule where most classes will earn some kind of capstone ability: Something that showcases mastery in whatever fighting style they possess. These features are usually purposefully designed to be overpowered and ridiculous.Level 12 is the level where all player characters acquire ascensions. Ascensions are mostly class agnostic features that add a lot of customization to the final level in the game.\nAscended characters are people that are incredibly significant to the world. These characters are the stuff of legend, and the abilities they acquire represent that. Their weapon becomes legendary, they become a demigod or they develop their own signature fighting style.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Classes","level":1,"id":"Classes_0"},{"heading":"<mark style=\"color:green;\">Level

For the purposes of this explanation, mana is primary used to fuel <a data-href=\"Technique\" href=\"techniques/technique.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Technique</a>s. It also fuels mana class abilities and is a crafting component. Mana itself has value.Mana Basics\nIn order to use a technique, you must spend mana equal to the tier of technique. Cantrips have an effective tier of 0 and do not cost mana. While not in immediate danger (such as combat or a chase), you regenerate 1 mana per turn, or 10 mana per minute.Upcast<br>\nBy spending more mana, you can increase the effectiveness of abilities with the <a data-href=\"Upcast\" href=\"techniques/upcast.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Upcast</a> tag. The degree to which varies by ability. Just because you have enough mana in your pool does not mean you can upcast an ability.<br>In order to upcast, you must meet a certain level requirement (see mana basics above) in addition to increasing the mana cost. For example <a data-href=\"imagination\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">imagination</a> has options up to upcast 5, effectively making that option a level 5 technique, requiring you to be level 9 to use it.Mana Reserves\nMana reserves function exactly like your base mana, except they disappear after used, and only regenerate after you rest.

Reduces by 1 unless stated otherwise. Usually goes away on rest. If an ability does not mention a mana cost, then it still reduces current and max mana by 1 if it has the mana burn tag.For clarity: Mana burn does not happen in addition to any mana cost.

Poise determines how difficult you are to toss around. It functions similarly to hp, but you subtract the attack roll from the target's poise. If this reduces them to 0 poise, they suffer the effects of the maneuver and their poise resets to maximum. Poise naturally resets after combat ends or by taking the total defense action. Other effects that toss characters around might also interact with poise.

If a DM makes frequent use of the resurrection spells for entities that the players went to great lengths to kill, it heavily undermines their effort and feels terrible, even if plausible. If all it takes is a bunch of money and a cleric, then rich high level players live in a world without death as a consequence for anybody.Now that we all agree about that, why does resurrection have an expensive material component cost? To punish the players for being unlucky? Why is it locked behind high-level magic? To make playing cleric mandatory? If we only consider the players, then these things become very obvious problems. Players shouldn't be shoehorned into playing specific classes, nor should the money that they worked hard to obtain be required to continue playing the game.The powers that be should instead be very particular about the who gets a second chance. If the players are the main character of the story, then the game's resurrection mechanics should treat them as such. As a replacement for most resurrection effects, use these rules instead. Or don't use resurrection at all. It's your game. Whatever.IMPORTANT NOTE: Please make sure your players are on board with whatever you decide. Nobody likes surprise mechanics.Isn't this just plot armor?\nThe basic premise of this system of resurrection is that you want player death to have immediate consequences: Not being able to complete a mission or delaying the players long enough so that way the villain can complete the ritual. But you don't want them to have long-term consequences: Not being able to play your character. Having to go on lengthy multi-session quests to find someone willing and able to cast the correct spell to bring you back can be fun, but after a few times, it can get old.So in order to achieve the former and avoid the latter, it's recommended that you bake the reason for the players coming back from the dead into the story. Death still matters or course, after all the players will have allies (:&lt;If your players aren't too attached to their characters, then who needs plot armor? Let 'em die. If they are, consider some of the options in this section.See:\n<a data-href=\"Ashen One\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/ashen-one.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ashen One</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Cloning Device\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/cloning-device.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cloning Device</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Limited Resurrection\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/limited-resurrection.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Limited Resurrection</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Tombstone\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/tombstone.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tombstone</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Withers\" href=\"core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/withers.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Withers</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/ashen-one.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/cloning-device.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/limited-resurrection.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/tombstone.html#_0","core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/withers.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/+death-and-resurrection.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753645040263,"modifiedTime":1754426752430,"sourceSize":2398,"sourcePath":"Core Rules, How to Play/Death and Resurrection/+Death and Resurrection.md","exportPath":"core-rules,-how-to-play/death-and-resurrection/+death-and-resurrection.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":342,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"core-rules,-how-to-play/hitpoints/+hp.html":{"title":"+HP","icon":"<span class=\"cm-iconize-icon\" aria-label=\"LiAnchor\" data-icon=\"LiAnchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: inline-flex; transform: translateY(13%);\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide-anchor\"><path d=\"M12 22V8\"></path><path d=\"M5 12H2a10 10 0 0 0 20 0h-3\"></path><circle cx=\"12\" cy=\"5\" r=\"3\"></circle></svg></span>","description":"How much hp a player has is largely determined by their class.
