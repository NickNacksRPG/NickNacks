Flares are more resilient than torches in that they can be tossed around, even in water, without worry of the light going out.With such a simple triggering mechanism, flares can easily be attached to trip wires, or have some kind of specific firing mechanism similar to a firearm to activate it while launching it high in the sky, or both (just as examples).]]></description><link>fixed-equipment-pl0x/equipment/alchemical-items/other-utility/flare.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Fixed Equipment Pl0x/equipment/alchemical-items/other-utility/flare.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:27:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[flash-freeze]]></title><description><![CDATA[Creating flash freeze requires the scale of a frost dragon to create, but the scale is a reusable component. Only small quantities of this substance can be created and contained at once.When poured over water, the oil pools on the surface and takes 1 round to spread out from the point of origin in a 20-foot radius. At the start of your next turn, the oil flash-freezes the surface of the water, creating an ice sheet over the affected area. Any 5-foot square of this ice can support ~500 pounds of weight. Weight in excess of this amount causes the entire sheet to crack and quickly break up. This ice sheet becomes unstable and breaks up on its own after 1 hour, or faster in a hot climate.

When you donate, you [mana burn] an equal amount. A creature can safely donate an amount of mana equal to their (max-1). There are usually safeguards against donating your max mana, but less savory individuals don't mind. Mana burning your max mana gives you a T3 affliction: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/EuW2xQOuMIcaalg1YNV3/afflictions/tier-3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/EuW2xQOuMIcaalg1YNV3/afflictions/tier-3" target="_self">Mana Starvation</a>. This means that most common people are only able to donate 1 mana each day. Children typically do not possess enough mana to safely donate.Specialized facilities and gilded altars are incredibly expensive, typically costing 100s of thousands of gold to craft. This makes it so facilities for mana donation tend to be rather sparse, only located in sizable settlements with magical and religious influence.When mana is extracted, it is turned into a mana crystal. Mana crystals are versatile and can change between states of matter, becoming either liquid or solid for ease of storage. Each point of mana can earn 4g in a mana extraction facility. In a church, it earns 5 GBP and food/lodging for the day.Most religious services happen in the evening after work, so that way people may spend their mana as they wish during the day, and donate it at night if they wish. With large generous populations this can mean that you can amass large quantities of mana rather quickly. Because most people can only donate 1 mana, you can almost 1:1 translate a population of donors to daily mana generation. Not everybody who donates has commoner tier mana, but at the same time, not everybody can always donate! So the 1:1 ratio is generally the go-to method of determining mana generation over time.Again, not all places have the correct facilities, so this is often available in villages.]]></description><link>fixed-equipment-pl0x/equipment/approximating-golds-value/economics/mana-donation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Fixed Equipment Pl0x/equipment/approximating-golds-value/economics/mana-donation.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:27:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[populations]]></title><description><![CDATA[Settlements receive classifications based on population. More populous settlements tend to condense more wealth, have more facilities and are more cosmopolitan. Certain types of services can be expected in larger settlements, but are unheard of in smaller ones.The settlements of Nack are generally less populous than those in our world, with even the biggest of cities having only hundreds of thousands of people.Hamlet - &lt;1,000 peopleVillage - 1,000+ peopleCity - 10,000+ peopleMetropolis - 100k+ peopleSome general assumptions about the population...
About 10% of the population is assumed to be over level 0, with a skew towards early levels.
Most regions have a dominant religion, with at around half the population favoring them. Metropolises break this mold by having more variety, while hamlets tend to have a much higher skew of 1 religion.

Divide this value by 250 to figure our your daily income. Most jobs tend to have weekly payouts. The chart below does this formula for you for most expected values.

Poor - Multiply all values by .5It also assumes the work provides value. If you are a butcher in a society of vegans, you will struggle to find work. Apply a multiplier in such circumstances.Service/Goods is Almost Useless - Multiply all values by .1

More details in the stats subsection.A standard rock costs 1,500g.If you would only like to rent one, you are typically limited to predesignated paths, such as state roads. It costs 10g for short trips within 600 miles, 30g for something between 2-6 days and 80g+ for anything longer.Prices for augments are included below. Using augmented rocks multiplies adds 50g to the price to rent them, with particularly expensive ones being even more expensive or unavailable for most customers.If the rock is lost, destroyed or damaged, the owner/company that provided the service expects compensation for replacements/repairs.All prices listed are in addition to the base 1,500g price.Offroad - 2,000g
Capable of traversing a specific type of terrain, such as forest regions, snow etc. Each sold separately.Climbing/Swimming - 1,000g

Fort +0, Refl +0, Will +0NoneVehicle - Standard rocks are streamlined to be useful as transportation and shipping vehicles, but leave a lot to be desired in terms of their combat capabilities. If attacked, a rock is helpless to stop its attacker aside from running away. As such, rocks must be kept away from danger.Ability Scores - Str +0, Dex +0, Lucc +0, Int -, Wis +0, Cha +0Speed - 100 land, increases to 45mph out of combat.
In ideal conditions, such as well-maintained roads, a rock can travel about 1000 miles a day, assuming it travels through the night, or 600 assuming it doesn't. These speeds are halved when moving through areas without well maintained roads, and reduced to 1/4 if you are traveling through wilderness with unwieldy terrain, such as snowy, sandy, mountainous or forested biomes. Some rocks come with specific terrains in mind and ignore such penalties.Camouflage - Wherever rocks are common (most places), it requires a DC 25 perception check to notice a rock is abnormal when it is not in use. A rock can hide any kinds of custom augmentations while camouflaged, including decorative additions like paint jobs.Autonomous - A rock is programmed to move towards specific well known destinations, in cardinal directions, or to move the path of least resistance towards a set of coordinates. If the rider wishes, there is also a driver's seat that allows them to more finely control the rock's movement. The autonomous driving controls leave a lot to be desired for sleeping passengers. You can get some sleep, but you do not gain the benefits of rest unless you stop to sleep.Seating/Storage - Rocks have compartments that can be easily hidden when not in use, both for seating and for storage. Standard rocks have seating to comfortably accommodate for 20 medium creatures. Such seating is protected from the elements via a weak magical barrier, capable of stopping small insects, wind and rain, but not arrows and swords.
They can carry up to 5000 lbs in a compartment that is 8x8x8ft.]]></description><link>fixed-equipment-pl0x/equipment/goods-and-services/rocks/rock-stats.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Fixed Equipment Pl0x/equipment/goods-and-services/rocks/rock-stats.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:27:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[In order to adventure, you need to eat, sleep and relax after a hard day of getting munched on by wolves.

Some more expensive ones may have access to special types of services, or provide you with connections to a specific type of clientele for an enormous price hike.Food/WaterIt costs 25g a week to keep yourself fed. Certain features, like proficiency in the survival skill or the Hellion's dirt consumption can significantly decrease or eliminate this cost.25 gold a week translates to ~110g a month or about ~1,300g a year.LodgingIt costs 100g a week to keep a roof over your head, provided you don't already have a house and need to acquire rooms at inns or pay farmers to sleep in barns. Sleeping out in the wilderness costs nothing, but can bring dangers like weather, monsters, thieves and the like.If you already own a house, this cost is decreased to 50g a week. This represents upkeep for your house in the wilderness or upkeep, taxes or loan repayments for your house in a city.100 gold a week translates to ~440g a month or about ~5,200g a year.
50 gold a week translates to ~220g a month or about ~2,600g a year.SuppliesAdventuring/travel requires a lot of miscellaneous things, amounting to 25g a week. Adventuring requires many things. You need to keep your swords sharp, your fires lit, your tents and bedrolls without holes etc. You're also gonna need a lot of rope.What counts as "adventuring" doesn't necessarily require you be out in the wilderness and could just as easily involve you snooping around towns gathering info, harassing farmers and exploring haunted houses.As a benefit for paying for supplies, you need not write down many miscellaneous items on your character sheet as you or a party member are assumed to have such things. This usually means something like a hammer, rope, flint and steel etc.25 gold a week translates to ~110g a month or about ~1,300g a year.Recovering from AfflictionsA night at the tavern is usually enough to wash away your woes, getting rid of all T1 afflictions. This usually involves you blowing a good amount of money all at once, costing 100g. General recovery can refer to visiting amusement parks or eating out at a nice restaurant.Such activities must always be performed at some type of "for leisure" location. It doesn't necessarily need to be in a settlement, so it could also include remote locations like hot springs in a mountain. Higher tiers of afflictions will likely require a specialist and a large degree of time. The cost for these services is tied to how long it takes to heal, using the <a class="internal-link" data-href="../approximating-golds-value/economics/" href=".html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">economics</a> chart to determine cost.

There are always 2 parties involved in a contract: the summoner and the summoned. Typically it is up to the summoner to convince the summoned to sign the contract, as the magic does not work with unwilling creatures. It is possible to find summoning contracts with a signature from a summoned creature, but not a summoner. Contracts are often temporary, being lifted after a certain number of summons, or after a specific task is complete.When the summoned creature signs the contract in blood, so to must the summoner. The summoned creature takes up a [companion] slot while summoned. 1/day as a FRA, you can summon the contracted creature. Creatures summoned in this way always have a pseudo-ethereal translucent quality to them that is easily identifiable (DC 10 arcana). A summon typically only lasts a minute, but can last up to an hour if the summoned creature accepts summoning sickness. The creature also gains summoning sickness if it drops to 0 hp while summoned.Summoning Sickness - A specific type of ailment that occurs as a result of a summoned creature pushing themselves too hard while summoned from a summoning contract, usually by sticking around for too long or being defeated. The creature is drained 2 and cannot be summoned for two weeks, even if the drain is removed.In most aspects, a summoned creature functions exactly as they would if you were fighting by their side in their actual body, with a few key differences. As a magical effect, they can be dispelled (DC 12+summoned creatures lvl). They have all of their gear and any resources that they expend (such as potions) while summoned are still expended when they return to their body. Summoned creatures only have 50% of their max hp.To the summoned creature, when you attempt to summon them, they receive a mental message from their summoner no longer than 2 sentences. They can choose to deny being summoned if they pass a will save (your class DC). If they succeed, they can send 2 sentences back. Otherwise, they enter a trance like state and their spirit leaves their body and appears next to you. If their body takes damage, or is otherwise harmed, then their spirit immediately winks out of existence.A summoned creature can dismiss itself as a standard action. A creature can only be summoned once per day.The more powerful a creature is, the more expensive it is to bind them to a summoning contract. If the contract has a limit on uses, adjust price as below.If the contract has stipulations that limit when the creature can be summoned, halve the cost again. (only summon vs fiends) Ex.

If you choose to delay this bonus, Determination does not consume your special attack next round.Special Attack: Stacking Strike - Make an attack. If this defeats the creature, stacking strike permanently gains 1 damage. Weapon specific, so you have to stack weapons individually. You cannot farm stacks passively and must gain them in combats you actually roll out.Special Attack: Bewildering Blow - On hit creature is confused for one round (will negates).Special Attack: Dispelling Strike - Roll an attack roll in place of a dispel check against a magical effect you can attack, including one on a creature.Special Attack: Meteor Swing - On hit your target is unable to make AoOs for 1 round.Special Attack: Ankle Slicer - On hit your target has -15 speed for 1 round.Special Attack: Lifesteal - On hit heal (2+level).Special Attack: Throat Slicer - On hit silence a creature for one round (fort negates).Special Attack: All In - On hit instead of rolling for damage, you deal maximum damage.

Compare your attack roll to all creatures in AoE. This requires a bow, which is a 2h ranged weapon without the reload property.Special Attack: Rapid Fire - Fire two shots in rapid succession at the same creature.
This requires a bow, which is a 2h ranged weapon without the reload property.Special Attack: Wild Strike - Swing around a flail without concern for the consequences. Deal an additional 7 damage. If you miss or graze, you instead treat the attack as if you grazed yourself.
This requires a flail, which is a 1h or 2h melee crush weapon.Special Attack: Hack n Smash - Perform a free sunder attack against an opponent's armor or shield.
This requires a hammer, which is a 1h or 2h melee crush weapon.Special Attack: Outmaneuver - While not being flanked, move 5 ft [elusive] and make a melee attack.
This requires a polearm, which 2h melee reach weapon.Special Attack: Dig Deep - Embed your weapon into your foe punch it in further, making them clumsy 2. They can remove it as a standard action, or a swift action with medicine proficiency. You let go of the weapon as part of using this special attack.
This requires a pick style weapon, which is a 1h or 2h melee pierce weapon.Special Attack: Execution - Finish them. Against a knocked down or grappled opponent, deal an additional 7 damage.

- Comes in a light variant (d6, 2 lbs , 120g) and a 2h battlestaff variant (2d6, 10 lbs, 200g)
- When you wield 2 staves, or have a staff and some other magical focus, you get a +1 boost to your CL- A large chunk of wood or metal with handles on one side to affix to your arm. Can be used to make shield actions.
- Comes with the CM (shove) quality
- Gives 5 poise
- Also comes in a tower shield variant, giving additional shield actions and 10 poise. (40 lbs, 100g)

Special Attack: Joust - When you make this attack while mounted and during a charge, your movement is [elusive] against your target. On hit dismounts the target.- Nets deal no damage, but instead inflict the entangled condition on hit
- The entangled condition can be removed by a creature succeeding on a athletics check (class dc) as a standard action, or automatically as a standard action if wielding a slash weapon.
- You still benefit from the CM (Drag) feature of the net as long as the creature is entangled.
- You can use nets to make drag combat maneuvers against targets within 20 ft. When you drag with a net, you forfeit entangling your target
- Nets can only be used once per combat since they must be refolded again to be effective- Boomerangs return to the user when thrown automatically, allowing multiple attacks with a single thrown weapon.
- Boomerangs curve, allowing you to hit opponents with total cover, so long as you aim for the correct space
- Boomerangs do not return when caught with something like a goo dragon's sticky
Special Attack: Wait For It... - Throw a boomerang at an unusual angle, initially missing a target. At the start of your next turn make an attack against them, but they're DD .- Harpoons come with a particularly strong 40 ft rope attached, allowing you to drag the weapon back to you in case you miss (standard action). Holding onto this rope after you toss uses a hand.
- Harpoons stick into the target. The bleed from this weapon cannot be stopped until after it is removed (class DC athletics, swift action).
- While embedded, you can make a drag attacks against the target without penalty from being at a range.- Bolas can be used to topple from a range.
- Bolas can only be used once per combat as they need to be untangled to be used properly- Requires an even more complex reloading process than crossbows. Their reload requires a FRA
-Pistols are 1h weapons, but they cannot be used to dual wield
- Also comes in a 2h rifle version that has the 2h property and does 2d8 dmg (10 lbs, 800g)- Has the same rules as guns plus the following…
- Simultaneously attacks every creature in a 15ft cone, comparing a single attack roll to all creature's AC
- Does not provoke from shooting in melee
- Not compatible with special attacks- Whips can be used to attack with 10 ft of extra reach, but do not threaten (meaning no AoOs)
- You can use the whip to grab objects and pull them adjacent to you, provided you would normally have been able to lift them.

All creatures are assumed to have a base speed of 30ft.Keep in mind a lot of the lore I use to describe races is used to differentiate a given race from the others. I personally don’t appreciate when elves are just long pretty people. I also make it to give people a starting point if they don't know how to roleplay or world build with a specific race.The descriptions you find here (or in any source really) are specifically tailored to a setting, or are the brain child of some other fantasy obsessed weirdo. They do not need to match how a specific race exists in your world if you have something else in mind.For example...
In the world I built my Lore around, Nack, elves primarily live in a continent known as "The Land of Storms" which has an absurdly high level of rainfall. As such, they developed a spell to combat it called Umbrella, which Elves often inherently learn, separate from any additional magic training. Doesn't make much sense for a subterranean elf now does it?{% hint style="danger" %}
Races very often offer skill bonuses. Skill bonuses from race do not stack unless the two features are a pair of minor and major features. So you couldn't pick goblin and get perception from mixed blood elf's "nice ears" for instance.The only exception to this is if the skill bonuses only apply to specific circumstances, such as a cyborgs sentinel build.

~={green}Random Bullshit Go =~- Throw an item that isn't a weapon. Improvised weapons can still be used. If you throw a harmful item, such as a <a data-href="toxin" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">toxin</a>, it applies on hit (then forcing saving throws as normal).

How they survived a bloody conflict, went through incredibly rigorous training to become the best and brightest mage, was chosen by god or some other equally astonishing development. Then the game says "you die in one hit to a goblin."While not entirely unrealistic, it doesn't make for very satisfying gameplay to have your character feel like they are made out of paper and are one stray crit away from instant death. A game like DnD 5e remedies this by making KO'd a state your character falls in and out of multiple times as a result of "le nat 20," spammable low action healing and a lack of negative hit points.If you want the player characters to be invincible compared to monsters of a similar level, I say skip the pretense. Player characters are of a different breed and are hardened by their previous adventures, granting the following benefits…HP - Your hp is increased by 10.
Defeat - You do not have a chance to instantly die when you fall unconscious, instead you receive a stacking debuff called <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://nick-nacks-rpg.gitbook.io/nicknacksrpg.com/the-rules/publish-your-docs-2/defeat" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://nick-nacks-rpg.gitbook.io/nicknacksrpg.com/the-rules/publish-your-docs-2/defeat" target="_self">doom</a>.

There are obviously other factors, but you can't ever keep adventuring without hp. Mana is the general resource system tied to using special abilities, and it naturally recharges when not used.In general healing that keeps you at full HP all the time is intended to be more scarce, and usually come at the cost of reducing your max mana until you rest.In general, only PCs will have this buff. But BBEGs, legendary creatures and other major bosses intended for use at the end of major story beats could also receive a similar version of this buff. Then you can get the juicy "phase transition" threshold to give your big boss encounters more punch.]]></description><link>classes/+class-details/quick-character-creation-guide/main-character-status.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/+Class Details/Quick Character Creation Guide/Main Character Status.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:03:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Quick Character Creation Guide]]></title><description><![CDATA[Read <a data-href="main character status" href="classes/+class-details/quick-character-creation-guide/main-character-status.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">main character status</a>!

Creatures with bite attacks gain a +4 bonus to attack against cookie creatures. A grandma can make a bite attack as an instant action against a creature that gets cookiefied.Bite^2 - If a xenomorph starts its turn grappling a creature, it can use its second mouth to blast a hole in the creature as its maintain option. The creature takes 8d6 (28) pierce damage and is drained 1 (fort halves dmg and negates drain).Hibernation - A xenomorph can willingly enter stasis permanently. It only leaves hibernation if it smells a creature.Stabilizing Compound - A xenomorphs blood reacts explosively when exposed to open air, but an informed alchemist can negate that. With a DC 21 alchemy check, an alchemist can create a compound that can disable a xenomorphs caustic blood feature for 1 minute as a FRA. You can apply it as a thrown attack, but it only functions for 1 round if you graze, and is consumed with no effect if you miss.

Poise 27 (DRA 3)
Fort +7, Refl +8, Will +4KYS (Su) [healing] [overheal] - Kopy yourself. While a creature you are copying is defeated and within reach, you can absorb data to repair damage as a swift action, healing 20 hp.Unarmed (C) +7 (+2 real deal)
d8+3 (7)Innate Techniques - Kidnap, Fake Out, Nice Catch
1/day - Toe Smasher, Feign DefeatReal Deal - While copying a creature, gain +2 attack against it.Copy: I'll have what she's having (Su) - As a swift action, a shadow can use it's copy ability to create a fully functional handheld object it can see within 30 ft. If the object is magical, it loses its magical properties. If the copied object gets more than 100 ft from the original, it disappears. Using copy in this way does not stun the shadow.Don't Tread on Me - Shadows are just that, shadows. Anything it copies is merely a projection. As such, it does not like it when objects interact with the shadow of its projection. It avoids people stepping on it, creatures walking over it etc. If the shadow's shadow is targeted directly, or included in an AoE effect, its DRA is ignored. If you target a shadow with a piercing melee weapon, you can embed it in the surface and entangle the shadow on hit or with a successful poise break, replacing all other effects and losing access to the weapon. Projectiles like arrows require 3 hits. Shadows cannot remove the entangling items on their own.Ability Scores - Str +3, Dex +2, Lucc +0, Int +0, Wis +0, Cha +0Copy (Su) [poly, true] - As a FRA, a shadow can emit a very bright flash of light while gazing upon a specific creature within 30 ft. When it does so It adds this creature to its memory. It can choose to immediately transform into this creature as part of this action. The replication process is almost perfect, giving the shadow access to the creatures memories, skill proficiencies, personality traits, current clothing, appearance, size etc. The shadow gains all of the racial features of the creature it copies (assuming a player character) or all of the natural attacks (including multi attack options)/movement abilities if it is not. A shadow can "memorize" copies of 4 different creatures/objects (see offense traits). It can transform into one as a standard action, or revert to its true form as a free action.When copying a creature, treat its disguise roll as 26.Speed - Speed(s) of copied creature. It can choose to enter a hybrid form, foiling its disguise, in order to move at a speed of 40, or climb 40.Feats - <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/combat-feats/unarmed-combatant" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/combat-feats/unarmed-combatant" target="_self">Unarmed Combatant</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/teamwork-feats/bonded-mind-su" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/teamwork-feats/bonded-mind-su" target="_self">Bonded Mind</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/teamwork-feats/feint-partner" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/teamwork-feats/feint-partner" target="_self">Feint Partner</a>Skills - +6 perception, +6 deception, +8 stealth<br><img alt="" src=".html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self">Shide, from the anime "<a href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/weapon-rules" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" class="is-unresolved">Summertime Rendering</a>"]]></description><link>bestiary/bestiary/aberrations/illumatrix.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">BESTIARY/bestiary/aberrations/illumatrix.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[mind-flayer]]></title><description><![CDATA[Masters of the psionic arts, these tentacled-lipped mages are vaguely humanoid with wet undulating orifices.

1/day - Nightmare, Domination, Order 66Power Word N (Su) [mind affecting] [language] [recharge] [subtle] - Slur'Nesh can utter a heinous word, and have it echo from the mouth of a creature within 60 feet. This word carries such vulgarity that it causes another creature within 30 ft of the original target to fly into a blind and senseless rage at the original target. They are taunted by the creature for 3 rounds, and use their deadliest most powerful abilities to kill them as quickly as possible.If the creature is a minion to Slur'Nesh, or if the secondary target has been subjugated by the race/people of the primary target, this has no save. If they are not they have disadvantage but (will negates). If the creatures have been allies for an extended amount of time, are family etc, then they do not make the save at disadvantage.Essentially, target 1 creature to taunt another with the power of racism. The two creatures relationship and races affect how difficult it is to resist.Summon Ally [companion] - 1 Living ForgeCycle of Hate - Superior Polymorph - Any successful checks to transform Slur'Nesh back into its true form instead deals 20 true damage to it.True Form - Slur'Nesh avoids its true form at all costs.

Can be used as a free action 1/turn.Rumormonger - Slur'Nesh can attempt to spread a rumor throughout a small town or larger settlement by attempting a deception check. The difficulty depends on the size, ranging from 10 for a small town to 30 for a metropolis, though this difficulty may be modified if the population as a whole tends towards skepticism or insanity.It takes a week for a rumor to spread.

Can be used as a free action 1/turn.Rumormonger - Slur'Nesh can attempt to spread a rumor throughout a small town or larger settlement by attempting a deception check. The difficulty depends on the size, ranging from 10 for a small town to 30 for a metropolis, though this difficulty may be modified if the population as a whole tends towards skepticism or insanity.It takes a week for a rumor to spread. If it succeeds by 5 or more, the time is reduced to 3 days. If it fails by 5 or more, the rumor mutates into a competing theory.Can only have 1 rumor brewing at once.Feats - SF Deception, SS Deception, SF Insight, SS InsightSkills - +15 perception, +19 (adv) insight, +19 (adv) deception, +19 disguise<img alt="" src=".html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" style="width: 321px; max-width: 100%;">From "The Invitation" chapter 2 by <a href="https://incase.buttsmithy.com/comic/the-invitation-ch-2-p-1/" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" class="is-unresolved">Incase</a>]]></description><link>bestiary/bestiary/fiends/the-master.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">BESTIARY/bestiary/fiends/the-master.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[tramp]]></title><description><![CDATA[You open a book and read some magic words only for a short fiend to pop out.

Some creatures have multiple types and I decided to put them in the camp they felt more at home in.Some creature types inherently have qualities, other just have a general vibe. Feel free to mix and match or add more!Some monsters will have tags listed at the top of their entry. There are general tags, and some specific to creature types.
One such tag is [unique]. These creatures are one of a kind. They usually have more complicated game plans to their tactics and have a very distinct identity that is separate from other creatures of the same type.

Lava is most commonly found around volcanoes, but can also be found erupting from the ocean floor and flowing through deep underground caverns.Lava typically comes in 2 variations; semisolid and liquid. Both are considered [persistent] effects.Semisolid Lava - Semisolid lava feels a bit like chunky mud if it melted your toes. Semisolid lava is difficult terrain, and every turn you move through it, you take 4d6 (14) fire damage.Liquid Lava - Liquid lava is much more dangerous since it can pool into large enough quantities for you to get completely submerged in. Each round you are submerged in lava, you take 10d6 (35) fire damage and are drained 1.If you survive that and manage to escape, lava still clings to you, burning you while it cools. This damage starts at 4d6 (14), then decreases by d6 each round until it ends. By taking cold damage, getting hit with a [water] effect or otherwise rapidly cooling or removing the clinging lava, you can avoid this damage over time. If you are only partially submerged, like if it is only waist deep, the initial damage is reduced to 6d6 (21) fire, and the cling damage starts at 3d6 (10) fire. ]]></description><link>bestiary/environmental-hazards/lava.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">BESTIARY/environmental-hazards/lava.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[What happens when you fall in lava?

Many creatures you encounter will be adapted to the environment they are in. You should probably not bother having lava affect creatures that are made of fire or obsidian for instance. These are soft immunities that are not included in the creature's stat block and should be granted based on vibes.

As far as visibility is concerned, most of the time you can see to the bottom of lakes and rivers unless they are particularly murky. Oceans, seas and particularly wide lakes or rivers are the exception to this, where they can be deep enough that even in ideal conditions you can't see all the way down.When a creature not in water attacks another creature that is at least waist deep in water, they have cover. Creatures not in water cannot attack creatures that are completely submerged if they are more than 5 feet deep.Underwater Combat - Fighting underwater can make many fighting styles completely useless. Projectile weapons like guns can't fire at all. Thrown weapons don't function at all either. Bows and such have their range reduced to 10/20 ft. Melee combatants take a -4 penalty to attack unless they use a piercing weapon.Many of these things have workarounds. Certain types of weapons can be specifically designed for underwater use. Aquatic creatures, amphibious creatures and creatures trained in athletics figure out methods to ignore the melee attacking penalty.Water Pressure - Roughly every 30 ft you descend into water, you double the amount of pressure your body experiences. Going past 150 ft is usually impossible without being an aquatic creature, special equipment or magic. If you do not have such aid, then going deeper than 60 ft is usually a bad idea. In combat you don't have the luxury of slowly ascending to avoid the bends.If you ascend more than 5 feet a round after diving to this depth, you must make fortitude save or become drained 1 and dazed. The DC is 20+every additional 5 feet you moved (10 feet DC 21, 20 ft DC 23 etc.). Even if you pass your save, you are still drained 1.Drowning - Most creatures can pretty handily hold their breath for 30 seconds while under duress (or 5 rounds). For every point of strength you can hold it for an additional round. Every round past this limit inflicts drain. The first round you drain 1, the second drain 2 etc, causing you to rapidly die if you are unable to somehow breathe.With specific equipment, magic or training, or being aquatic/amphibious, you can increase or eliminate this limit entirely. The most common way is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/alchemical-items/potions/gillweed" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/alchemical-items/potions/gillweed" target="_self">gillweed</a>.]]></description><link>bestiary/environmental-hazards/water.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">BESTIARY/environmental-hazards/water.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[boss-creatures]]></title><link>bestiary/monster-qualities/boss-creatures.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">BESTIARY/monster-qualities/boss-creatures.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[defense-traits]]></title><description><![CDATA[AmorphousIn order to crit the creature, you must exceed its AC by a value higher than 10.ExampleAmorphous - +15Damage Reduction (DR)Damage reduction (shortened DR) is a unique defensive property that comes in two different forms. Whenever a creature takes damage that their DR applies to, reduce the damage by the corresponding amount.
Denoted as follows. The x represents a numerical value.DR x
Only applies to physical damage (Crush, slash, Pierce) and poise damage. Some instances of DR only apply to poise damage from specific combat maneuversDRA x
Applies to all damage types (minus true damage)All forms of damage reduction stack with each other. Damage reduction applies in the most advantageous way possible for the creature (after halving from saves or resistances for example). If an attack's damage is reduced to zero, any additional effects the attack would apply do not occur.Fast HealingThe creature gains specified amount of hp the start of their turn if they are not defeated. When the creature is defeated, this ability is disabled for 10 minutes (see <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/medicine" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/medicine" target="_self">medicine</a> for other means to keep those pesky healers down).If a creature with FH is bleeding, roll a luck check (DC 10) to see if the bleeding stops at the end of their turns.FerocityWhen the creature is reduced to zero hit points, they are not defeated until the end of their next turn. On said turn they are staggered. If a creature with ferocity is healed before their next turn, the creature is not defeated at the end of its next turn, and this ability is not consumed, however they are still staggered.This ability can only activate once per minute.FH does not function while in ferocity.IncorporealIncorporeal creatures have resistance to crush, slash and pierce damage. They cannot be combat maneuvered without special equipment or techniques. Incorporeal creatures universally have hover speeds.Incorporeal creatures can pass through physical objects, but cannot end their turn inside of one. This allows them to ignore cover bonuses and more easily hide.ImmunityRare defensive quality. This creature is immune to a specific type of status effect and/or damage type.A common one is mindless creatures (creatures that lack an intelligence score, denoted by a - in the ability scores section) are immune to mind-affecting effects like fear and charm.ResistanceWhen a creature has resistance to a type of status effect or damage type, the creature takes only half damage from effects that deal that damage type.When a creature has a resistance to a tag, it lists the numerical value that it gets a bonus to saves against abilities with that tag (such as [fear] [charm] etc).{% hint style="success" %}
Creatures with resistance to poison also have a +4 bonus to the envenomed condition
{% endhint %}RegenerationThe creature regains a specified amount of hp at the start of their turn. This healing is capable of restoring lost limbs over a few days, or instantly if the limb is reattached. At the start of this creature's turn it loses the defeated condition, restores HP, and the creature is staggered instead of dazed.All forms of regeneration have some means to stop it (typically for 1 round), usually taking a specific type of damage. <br>If a creature is defeated while its regeneration is disabled, it is unable to regenerate for 10 minutes (see <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/medicine" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/medicine" target="_self">medicine</a> for other means to keep those pesky healers down).]]></description><link>bestiary/monster-qualities/defense-traits.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">BESTIARY/monster-qualities/defense-traits.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[fundamentals]]></title><description><![CDATA[Natural AttacksIt's very common for monsters to have sharp claws and teeth, but having more claws and more teeth doesn't necessarily lead to them having more attacks. In a typical bestiary stat block, a monster will have sets of attack actions each with their own specified stats.If a creatures stats mentions the multi-attack property, then when they take a standard action to attack, they are allowed to make multiple attacks of the specified types. Some creatures have conditional multiattacks.ExampleSting (P) +3
2d6+2 (9)Multiattack - Can only be made against creatures with a speed of 0 (entangle, stun etc). Make 2 sting attacks.Innate CastingSome techniques can be granted outside of the standard progression, such as things gained from race, class, magic items, specialized training, or some kind of boon granted by another creature. Usually quite limited in scope and much more common on monsters.Innate techniques do not take up memory slots and are always memorized.Innate techniques grant creatures the ability to use a specific set of techniques. Spells do not require the staff/seal component that other casting typically requires. If a spell has a material or focus component, that is also ignored with innate casting. By default, creatures with innate techniques can use their techniques an unlimited number of times. Number values are included next to techniques that have limited uses per day.Mana burn still applies to innately casted spells.If a spell is constant, the spell is persistently active on the creature and takes up its [buff] slot. A new buff can be cast on it, rendering the constant spell inactive. If it's constant spell is deactivated, it can reactivate it as a swift action.]]></description><link>bestiary/monster-qualities/fundamentals.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">BESTIARY/monster-qualities/fundamentals.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[groups]]></title><description><![CDATA[Packs of beasts, platoons of soldiers and swarms of insects are all groups of weaker enemies that have slightly different representation than a typical monster.

Some are passive some require activation. All auras are [persistent] effects, meaning creature can only be affected by a negative aura once per round.Breath Weapon (Su)The creature has the ability to use a supernatural area of effect attack. Common forms include lines and cones of elemental damage.Most breath weapons are [recharge] effects that have some condition to use them again.DeathrattleAn effect happens when the creature dies, requiring no action. This typically involves exploding or releasing toxic gases.Gaze (Su)Merely by looking at another creature nearby, they can inflict some kind of effect. The creature can use a standard action in order to gaze at a specific creature within 30 ft. Some creatures have gaze attacks that automatically happen to all creatures within a specific range.Anybody combating a creature with a gaze attack has a few options to try and negate it, made when they first are affected by the gaze attack.
They can choose to close their eyes (instant action), giving themselves the blinded condition until the start of their next turn, making them immune gaze attacks.
Alternatively they can choose to avert their gaze, giving them blurred vision and advantage on saves against gaze attacks.
Gaze attacks can be avoided entirely by looking at the creature through a proxy, like a reflective surface.Grappling AbilitiesAttach - When the creature grapples another creature it instead gains the grappled condition, typically due to its smaller size. Creatures with the attached property typically have special abilities that can only be used while attached.Constrict - When a creature with the constrict property succeeds on a grapple check they automatically deal damage from a specified attack form. Every turn they maintain the grapple they also do this effect.Engulf - When the creature succeeds on a grapple check they can engulf the target. The target gains the entombed condition. Usually the creature can take no action other than to use athletics to escape.Allies can use athletics to pull you out or poise break the creature to set you free.Swallow - After successfully grappling a creature, the creature can choose to swallow its prey if it is at least one size category larger. The prey maintains the grapple penalties and the swallowing creature doesn't need to take any actions to maintain the grapple. The prey gains total cover and takes a specified amount of damage the turn it is swallowed immediately and at the end of the swallowed creatures turn thereafter.A creature cannot use its swallow quality while sickened 2 or higher. Becoming sickened 2 causes it to vomit any swallowed creatures.The prey escapes automatically when the swallowing creature is defeated.Powerful ChargeThe creature gets a +2 bonus to attack during any round they make a charge.RendWhenever the creature lands the listed attacks (including poise breaking the creature), they inflict an additional effect, usually damage.ExampleRend - Two claws (2d6)Summon Ally (Su) [companion]Functions like a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/magic-items/interesting-items/summoning-contract" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/magic-items/interesting-items/summoning-contract" target="_self">summoning contract</a>, but does not require a contract, usually only summoning lesser creatures. Only requires a standard action and can potentially summon multiple creature at once.Can also grant other bonuses to summoned creatures, in addition to the companion boost to attack.TrampleCreature can move around through other creatures spaces to knock them over. As a FRA a creature can move its speed, or double its speed in a straight line, and harm all creatures along its path, dealing damage and knocking them down. Creatures can choose to either AoO or make a reflex save for a reduced effect.VenomousInflicts the Envenomed status effect with one of its attacks or abilities, which functions as follows.Venom comes in 3 stages. In order to advance from one to the next, the afflicted creature must fail a fortitude save. The venom continues until they creature passes a fortitude save. Some creatures may have different effects for their venom, but this is the assumed default if no other details are listed.Stage 1 - Creature is sickened 1, which cannot be removed until the creature is no longer poisoned.
1 minute after the creature fails its first save, it must roll again or hit stage 2. Stage 2 - Creature is sickened 2, which cannot be removed until the creature is no longer poisoned. The creature also has disadvantage on skill checks.
10 minutes after the creature fails its second save, it must roll again.Stage 3 - Creature is sickened 3, which cannot be removed until the creature is no longer poisoned. The creature gains the defeated condition.In stage 3, a creature must roll a save every 10 minutes. Each failure adds a stack of drain.]]></description><link>bestiary/monster-qualities/offense-traits.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">BESTIARY/monster-qualities/offense-traits.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[other-traitss]]></title><description><![CDATA[AmphibiousAmphibious creatures can exist comfortably on land or underwater, including the ability to breathe underwater or the ability to hold their breath for long periods of time.BlindsenseThis creature has extraordinary senses that allows it to sense the presence of creatures without sight. A creature with blind sense has +4 bonus on perception against a creature to which its blindsense applies. The creature automatically receives a perception check with no penalty when a creature enters this range, even while naturally asleep, and automatically wakes up if it senses something.A successful perception check indicates the creature has "locked on" and identified the space the creature is in. They gain seeking against any creature "locked on." Once a creature with blind sense has "locked on" to a creature, it stays detected until it leaves the creature's blindsense range, or the creatures blind sense is disabled.A creature with blind sense can use the "detect hidden presence" feature of perception as a free action once per turn, but only the affecting the range of its blind sense.Blind sense relies on a specific sense (mentioned in the ability), usually hearing or scent, but can also include things like detecting life (with undead creatures), or feeling tremors in the ground/water. Blind sense can circumstantially be negated, based on the source.Echolocation - Sound based. A creature that takes sonic damage has their echolocation disabled for one round.Lifesense (Su) - Functions against living creatures. Undead, constructs (and other similar not really alive) creatures cannot be detected with life sense.Scent - Uses a creature sense of smell. Aquatic creatures can only use this underwater. Amphibious creatures can use it in water or land. If you have an item with a creatures scent on it, you get a +2 bonus on survival checks to track them. Scents can be remembered similarly to how you can recognize someone's voice. Creatures with scent automatically get a perception check (vs disguise) against someone impersonating a creature they are very close to.A creature that is sickened cannot use scent.Tremorsense - Vibration based. Aquatic creatures can use this underwater. Amphibious creatures can use it in water or land. Only functions if the creature (and any creatures it is attempting to detect) is in direct contact with a physical surface.A creature that is clumsy cannot use tremorsense.Thought Sense (Su) - Functions against intelligent creatures. Mindless creatures cannot be detected with thought sense. A creature that is shaken cannot use thought sense.Sightless Blind Sense - In the absence of sight, blindsense is enhanced. The usual methods for preventing blindsense (sickened with super scent) from functioning impose partial concealment on all creatures that their blindsense cannot negate until the condition is removed.Creatures with sightless blindsense instead get a +8 bonus to perception when blindsense applies and its range is usually higher.CompressionYou are able to move through spaces designed for creatures 1 size smaller than you without treating it as difficult terrain. You are able to move through spaces designed for creatures 2 sizes smaller than you by treating it as difficult terrainCamouflageCreature can use stealth to hide without cover or concealment. Cannot be used while being directly observed.May come with other conditions for use.Hide in Plain SightCreature has the ability to successfully hide from creatures while standing perfectly still by pretending to be an inanimate object or changing colors. If the creature is already being observed, or enemies have already been surprised by the creature using this ability recently, then it does not function.Typically creatures do not get a check to see a creature that is hiding in plain sight until they go out of their way to inspect the nearby area, or the hiding creature acts.The DC to detect them is based on their offense trait DC rather than stealth, but functions similarly when used to surprise attack. If creature has stealth, they can choose to roll it as normal to ambush.Movement TypesBurrow - A creature with a burrow speed can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock, unless the descriptive text says otherwise. Creatures leaves a temporary trail behind, unless measures are taken to maintain the hole. You cannot charge while burrowing. Starting to burrow underground requires a swift action and provokes an AoO as though moving out of a threatened space.Climb - A creature with a climb speed can easily ascend or descend trees, walls buildings etc, provided there are ample places to place hands, feet etc. Creatures with climb speeds can even climb things without ample handholds using creative methods or exceptional biology in some cases (gecko, snake wrapping around).Flight - You can use a fly speed to move directly up into the air. Any movement moving up at greater than a 45 degree angle is considered difficult terrain. Taking flight requires a swift action that provokes attacks of opportunity as though moving out of a threatened space.Whenever you take damage while flying, gain clumsy 1. You cannot ascend while clumsy.Creatures with flight automatically also have glide.While a creatures speed is reduced to zero, it cannot fly, and plummets.Glide - While not movement impaired, take no fall damage. Reduce any fall damage to minimum value. When falling, move horizontally 5 feet per 1 foot fallen at a speed of 60.Hover - A lesser form of flight, or perhaps something supernatural like telekinesis. Functions as a land speed, but you float around a foot above the ground, allows you to ignore small changes in terrain. Some creatures can use hover to fly during their turn, but they must end their movement hovering over flat-ish ground. You cannot use hover to temporarily fly while clumsy. While clumsy, your hover speed is reduced by 15.Swim - Creatures with a swim speed take no penalties to fighting underwater. Most creatures with a swim speed are either aquatic or amphibious.Polymorph (Su)[Poly]Allows a creature to turn into a different creature. The description of the ability will include the features that it gains when it does so (based off of the features of the shapeshifter class). If there are no listed features then assumes that it gains none. While polymorphed a creature is unable to use any of the abilities based on its physical form, such as its natural attacks or poison, if they originate from their original form.Descriptions typically use features from the shapeshifter class.ExPolymorph: Humanoid (Su) [poly, true] - Any medium or small humanoidPolymorph: Beast, Dog (Su) [poly, true] - Attack (bite), Manhandle (topple)Special SensesDarkvision - You can see well in complete darkness. Treat any form of darkness as bright light. Everything in darkness is grayscale.Green Sight (Su) - Can see through any form of vegetation. Creatures cannot use vegetation as a source of cover to hide against this creature.Nightvision - A lesser form of darkvision. You treat dim light as bright light. You treat darkness as dim light. These effects do not combine to allow you to treat darkness as bright light. Everything in darkness is grayscale.Telepathy (Su)The creature can speak directly into the minds of other creatures it can see. A creature must have an intelligence score of at least -2 in order to be telepathically communicated with. A creature can telepathically project its thoughts to several creatures in the nearby vicinity, even if it cannot see them. Once a creature initiates a telepathic conversation, the other creature can communicate back using telepathy. The creature that initiated the telepathic conversation can choose to end it whenever they wish.]]></description><link>bestiary/monster-qualities/other-traitss.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">BESTIARY/monster-qualities/other-traitss.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[weaknesses]]></title><description><![CDATA[Monsters often have specific and niche weaknesses, allowing characters with specific skills or abilities to exploit the monster in a specific way.There are also generic weaknesses.WeaknessMany creatures are susceptible to specific forms of attack.

When you donate, you [mana burn] an equal amount. A creature can safely donate an amount of mana equal to their (max-1). There are usually safeguards against donating your max mana, but less savory individuals don't mind. Mana burning your max mana gives you a T3 affliction: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/EuW2xQOuMIcaalg1YNV3/afflictions/tier-3" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/EuW2xQOuMIcaalg1YNV3/afflictions/tier-3" target="_self">Mana Starvation</a>. This means that most common people are only able to donate 1 mana each day. Children typically do not possess enough mana to safely donate.Specialized facilities and gilded altars are incredibly expensive, typically costing 100s of thousands of gold to craft. This makes it so facilities for mana donation tend to be rather sparse, only located in sizable settlements with magical and religious influence.When mana is extracted, it is turned into a mana crystal. Mana crystals are versatile and can change between states of matter, becoming either liquid or solid for ease of storage. Each point of mana can earn 4g in a mana extraction facility. In a church, it earns 5 GBP and food/lodging for the day.Most religious services happen in the evening after work, so that way people may spend their mana as they wish during the day, and donate it at night if they wish. With large generous populations this can mean that you can amass large quantities of mana rather quickly. Because most people can only donate 1 mana, you can almost 1:1 translate a population of donors to daily mana generation. Not everybody who donates has commoner tier mana, but at the same time, not everybody can always donate! So the 1:1 ratio is generally the go-to method of determining mana generation over time.Again, not all places have the correct facilities, so this is often available in villages.]]></description><link>equipment/economics/equipment/approximating-golds-value/economics/mana-donation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">EQUIPMENT/ECONOMICS/equipment/approximating-golds-value/economics/mana-donation.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[populations]]></title><description><![CDATA[Settlements receive classifications based on population. More populous settlements tend to condense more wealth, have more facilities and are more cosmopolitan. Certain types of services can be expected in larger settlements, but are unheard of in smaller ones.The settlements of Nack are generally less populous than those in our world, with even the biggest of cities having only hundreds of thousands of people.Hamlet - &lt;1,000 peopleVillage - 1,000+ peopleCity - 10,000+ peopleMetropolis - 100k+ peopleSome general assumptions about the population...
About 10% of the population is assumed to be over level 0, with a skew towards early levels.
Most regions have a dominant religion, with at around half the population favoring them. Metropolises break this mold by having more variety, while hamlets tend to have a much higher skew of 1 religion.

More details in the stats subsection.A standard rock costs 1,500g.If you would only like to rent one, you are typically limited to predesignated paths, such as state roads. It costs 10g for short trips within 600 miles, 30g for something between 2-6 days and 80g+ for anything longer.Prices for augments are included below. Using augmented rocks multiplies adds 50g to the price to rent them, with particularly expensive ones being even more expensive or unavailable for most customers.If the rock is lost, destroyed or damaged, the owner/company that provided the service expects compensation for replacements/repairs.All prices listed are in addition to the base 1,500g price.Offroad - 2,000g
Capable of traversing a specific type of terrain, such as forest regions, snow etc. Each sold separately.Climbing/Swimming - 1,000g

Fort +0, Refl +0, Will +0NoneVehicle - Standard rocks are streamlined to be useful as transportation and shipping vehicles, but leave a lot to be desired in terms of their combat capabilities. If attacked, a rock is helpless to stop its attacker aside from running away. As such, rocks must be kept away from danger.Ability Scores - Str +0, Dex +0, Lucc +0, Int -, Wis +0, Cha +0Speed - 100 land, increases to 45mph out of combat.
In ideal conditions, such as well-maintained roads, a rock can travel about 1000 miles a day, assuming it travels through the night, or 600 assuming it doesn't. These speeds are halved when moving through areas without well maintained roads, and reduced to 1/4 if you are traveling through wilderness with unwieldy terrain, such as snowy, sandy, mountainous or forested biomes. Some rocks come with specific terrains in mind and ignore such penalties.Camouflage - Wherever rocks are common (most places), it requires a DC 25 perception check to notice a rock is abnormal when it is not in use. A rock can hide any kinds of custom augmentations while camouflaged, including decorative additions like paint jobs.Autonomous - A rock is programmed to move towards specific well known destinations, in cardinal directions, or to move the path of least resistance towards a set of coordinates. If the rider wishes, there is also a driver's seat that allows them to more finely control the rock's movement. The autonomous driving controls leave a lot to be desired for sleeping passengers. You can get some sleep, but you do not gain the benefits of rest unless you stop to sleep.Seating/Storage - Rocks have compartments that can be easily hidden when not in use, both for seating and for storage. Standard rocks have seating to comfortably accommodate for 20 medium creatures. Such seating is protected from the elements via a weak magical barrier, capable of stopping small insects, wind and rain, but not arrows and swords.
They can carry up to 5000 lbs in a compartment that is 8x8x8ft.]]></description><link>equipment/economics/equipment/goods-and-services/rocks/rock-stats.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">EQUIPMENT/ECONOMICS/equipment/goods-and-services/rocks/rock-stats.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[In order to adventure, you need to eat, sleep and relax after a hard day of getting munched on by wolves.

Certain features, like proficiency in the survival skill or the Hellion's dirt consumption can significantly decrease or eliminate this cost.25 gold a week translates to ~110g a month or about ~1,300g a year.LodgingIt costs 100g a week to keep a roof over your head, provided you don't already have a house and need to acquire rooms at inns or pay farmers to sleep in barns. Sleeping out in the wilderness costs nothing, but can bring dangers like weather, monsters, thieves and the like.If you already own a house, this cost is decreased to 50g a week. This represents upkeep for your house in the wilderness or upkeep, taxes or loan repayments for your house in a city.100 gold a week translates to ~440g a month or about ~5,200g a year.
50 gold a week translates to ~220g a month or about ~2,600g a year.SuppliesAdventuring/travel requires a lot of miscellaneous things, amounting to 25g a week. Adventuring requires many things.

This usually involves you blowing a good amount of money all at once, costing 100g. General recovery can refer to visiting amusement parks or eating out at a nice restaurant.Such activities must always be performed at some type of "for leisure" location. It doesn't necessarily need to be in a settlement, so it could also include remote locations like hot springs in a mountain. Higher tiers of afflictions will likely require a specialist and a large degree of time.

There are always 2 parties involved in a contract: the summoner and the summoned. Typically it is up to the summoner to convince the summoned to sign the contract, as the magic does not work with unwilling creatures. It is possible to find summoning contracts with a signature from a summoned creature, but not a summoner. Contracts are often temporary, being lifted after a certain number of summons, or after a specific task is complete.When the summoned creature signs the contract in blood, so to must the summoner. The summoned creature takes up a [companion] slot while summoned. 1/day as a FRA, you can summon the contracted creature. Creatures summoned in this way always have a pseudo-ethereal translucent quality to them that is easily identifiable (DC 10 arcana). A summon typically only lasts a minute, but can last up to an hour if the summoned creature accepts summoning sickness. The creature also gains summoning sickness if it drops to 0 hp while summoned.Summoning Sickness - A specific type of ailment that occurs as a result of a summoned creature pushing themselves too hard while summoned from a summoning contract, usually by sticking around for too long or being defeated. The creature is drained 2 and cannot be summoned for two weeks, even if the drain is removed.In most aspects, a summoned creature functions exactly as they would if you were fighting by their side in their actual body, with a few key differences. As a magical effect, they can be dispelled (DC 12+summoned creatures lvl). They have all of their gear and any resources that they expend (such as potions) while summoned are still expended when they return to their body. Summoned creatures only have 50% of their max hp.To the summoned creature, when you attempt to summon them, they receive a mental message from their summoner no longer than 2 sentences. They can choose to deny being summoned if they pass a will save (your class DC). If they succeed, they can send 2 sentences back. Otherwise, they enter a trance like state and their spirit leaves their body and appears next to you. If their body takes damage, or is otherwise harmed, then their spirit immediately winks out of existence.A summoned creature can dismiss itself as a standard action.

This requires a monthly cleaning and reapplication to maintain the anti-divination properties.A bucket of paint can cover the average sized room.

If you choose to delay this bonus, Determination does not consume your special attack next round.Special Attack: Stacking Strike - Make an attack. If this defeats the creature, stacking strike permanently gains 1 damage. Weapon specific, so you have to stack weapons individually. You cannot farm stacks passively and must gain them in combats you actually roll out.Special Attack: Bewildering Blow - On hit creature is confused for one round (will negates).Special Attack: Dispelling Strike - Roll an attack roll in place of a dispel check against a magical effect you can attack, including one on a creature.Special Attack: Meteor Swing - On hit your target is unable to make AoOs for 1 round.Special Attack: Ankle Slicer - On hit your target has -15 speed for 1 round.Special Attack: Lifesteal - On hit heal (2+level).Special Attack: Throat Slicer - On hit silence a creature for one round (fort negates).Special Attack: All In - On hit instead of rolling for damage, you deal maximum damage.

This requires a bow, which is a 2h ranged weapon without the reload property.Special Attack: Wild Strike - Swing around a flail without concern for the consequences. Deal an additional 7 damage. If you miss or graze, you instead treat the attack as if you grazed yourself.
This requires a flail, which is a 1h or 2h melee crush weapon.Special Attack: Hack n Smash - Perform a free sunder attack against an opponent's armor or shield.
This requires a hammer, which is a 1h or 2h melee crush weapon.Special Attack: Outmaneuver - While not being flanked, move 5 ft [elusive] and make a melee attack.

- Comes in a light variant (d6, 2 lbs , 120g) and a 2h battlestaff variant (2d6, 10 lbs, 200g)
- When you wield 2 staves, or have a staff and some other magical focus, you get a +1 boost to your CL- A large chunk of wood or metal with handles on one side to affix to your arm. Can be used to make shield actions.
- Comes with the CM (shove) quality

Special Attack: Joust - When you make this attack while mounted and during a charge, your movement is [elusive] against your target. On hit dismounts the target.- Nets deal no damage, but instead inflict the entangled condition on hit
- The entangled condition can be removed by a creature succeeding on a athletics check (class dc) as a standard action, or automatically as a standard action if wielding a slash weapon.
- You still benefit from the CM (Drag) feature of the net as long as the creature is entangled.
- You can use nets to make drag combat maneuvers against targets within 20 ft. When you drag with a net, you forfeit entangling your target
- Nets can only be used once per combat since they must be refolded again to be effective- Boomerangs return to the user when thrown automatically, allowing multiple attacks with a single thrown weapon.
- Boomerangs curve, allowing you to hit opponents with total cover, so long as you aim for the correct space
- Boomerangs do not return when caught with something like a goo dragon's sticky
Special Attack: Wait For It... - Throw a boomerang at an unusual angle, initially missing a target. At the start of your next turn make an attack against them, but they're DD .- Harpoons come with a particularly strong 40 ft rope attached, allowing you to drag the weapon back to you in case you miss (standard action). Holding onto this rope after you toss uses a hand.
- Harpoons stick into the target. The bleed from this weapon cannot be stopped until after it is removed (class DC athletics, swift action).
- While embedded, you can make a drag attacks against the target without penalty from being at a range.- Bolas can be used to topple from a range.
- Bolas can only be used once per combat as they need to be untangled to be used properly- Requires an even more complex reloading process than crossbows. Their reload requires a FRA
-Pistols are 1h weapons, but they cannot be used to dual wield
- Also comes in a 2h rifle version that has the 2h property and does 2d8 dmg (10 lbs, 800g)- Has the same rules as guns plus the following…
- Simultaneously attacks every creature in a 15ft cone, comparing a single attack roll to all creature's AC
- Does not provoke from shooting in melee
- Not compatible with special attacks- Whips can be used to attack with 10 ft of extra reach, but do not threaten (meaning no AoOs)
- You can use the whip to grab objects and pull them adjacent to you, provided you would normally have been able to lift them.

Multiclass - This feat allows you to borrow a feature from another class. Usually such features are secondary features of the class, or are there for flavor.Teamwork - A teamwork feat requires more than one creature to possess in order to function, usually providing some kind of synergistic effect.

An ancient and powerful pact is in place that prevents the gods from seizing mortals as puppets to enact their will, and forces them to figure out more subtle and indirect means of acquiring what they want.This same pact makes them immune to conventional weapons. Gods have so much mana flowing through them that no singular person is close to powerful enough to even scratch them. This same mana allows them to perform incredible feats, often referred to as miracles. Gods are free to walk amongst mortals only sparingly, as doing so requires a great deal of mana. As such they usually prefer only to appear in their <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://nick-nacks-rpg.gitbook.io/nicknacksrpg.com/classes/classes/ascendance/demigod" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://nick-nacks-rpg.gitbook.io/nicknacksrpg.com/classes/classes/ascendance/demigod" target="_self">Deific Aspects</a>, which only allow them to exert a fraction of their power, and appear as a translucent spectral version of themselves. They can also appear as a mortal, unable to exert any of their usual deific powers, and usually having a hard time gathering the attention of mortals. They also use other indirect means, such as using their followers as vessels, projecting only their voice or having their messages appear in writing via ink or blood.Gods are not all-knowing, nor are they all-powerful. They have the ability to focus their attention on many places at once, with much greater detail in places where their followers exist. They hear and answer prayers while doing other things. Their ability to multi-task and process information is beyond comprehension. Certain types of things may draw their focus, such as hearing a prayer related to a matter that interests them, or a ritual in their honor conducted by one of their favorite disciples, or an enemy defacing their places of worship.Gods must carefully consider what they focus their attention on, and what they do. Their existence may seem immutable, but the countless gods lost to time suggest otherwise. They must satisfy the desires of mortals, lest they lose their source of power. As such, gods tend to only give boons to the dedicated, and only make appearances amongst mortals if it can be flashy and garner a lot of attention. A constant form of pageantry they must perform in order to maintain their power and increase their influence.]]></description><link>gods/favor-of-gods/power-of-god/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Gods/favor-of-gods/power-of-god/README.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[anime-jesus]]></title><description><![CDATA[Anime Jesus is the anime god of order.

The exact circumstances of their creation are unknown, but they typically end up as large muscular demons, and are always women.Unfortunately for these ladies, mom's standards couldn't be higher: They must become stronger than their mother.

Their method of testing your might is typically an arm wrestling contest. This is often used as a last ditch effort by people to save their own skins when faced with overwhelming odds of death.On rare occasions, her followers will kidnap specimens they deem worthy enough. They will be dragged into the demon realm to have all manner of alchemical, magical and genetic experiments run on them to create a creature that is perfectly huge.Caldera herself is a massive muscular woman clad in metal armor who typically stands over 20 feet tall. Her body is covered in all manner of bony spikes, horns and scales.

Such pacts bind the 2 creatures to these agreements, with immediate consequences if one does not abide by the agreement.Pacts, like written contracts in real life, are methods of binding 2 parties together to persuade some time of cooperation or exchange. It usually involves exchanging goods, services, information or boons. Typically pacts are formed when someone desires something, but the other doesn't want to grant this desire for free. Both parties mediate until a satisfactory transaction is agreed upon. Then the 2 parties must decide on a punishment for the other should they not fulfill their end of the bargain. Again, the 2 parties come to an agreement on what the other desires. Finally, some type of gesture is taken to finalize the deal, such as shaking hands, returning a bow or signing a contract.Some creatures may take issue with the order in which the parties perform their end of the bargain, but it is inevitably up to the creature with the power to make the pact what order things happen in.Pacts, unlike written contracts in real life, cannot be broken without evading consequence. Pacts are made with magic that does not ask for mediation or a jury. Disobeying the contract immediately afflicts the creature with whatever the punishment is. Any kind of agreement must be within the means of the creature to perform. In the event where someone is unable to hold up their end of the bargain, or does so in a way that is not in accordance with the deal, they are afflicted with punishment immediately. You cannot also say "I will grant you anything you wish" without the ability to grant wishes. Punishments must also be within the means of both parties. You cannot just say "if you don't pet this dog 10 times then you burst into flames and die" without being able to use some type of fire magic. If you agree on a punishment that you cannot inflict, then there is no consequence for not fulfilling their end of the bargain. It us up to you to decide if the other really CAN devour your eternal soul or not.Shira, and her most dedicated, are capable of providing additional boons to those they make pacts with. Contracts without meaning, such as those made between allies to acquire more boons, will draw Shira's ire and are not recommended.Twist of Fate - The creature gains a luck dice.Lexicon - Give creature information about a subject as though asking Shira herself. The amount of information she gives typically depends on what was done in the contract. Good deeds get the bare minimum to satisfy the contract while deeds that align with Shira's interest are paid in dividends.]]></description><link>gods/gods/demon-lords/shira-the-she-devil/fiendish-pacts.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Gods/gods/demon-lords/shira-the-she-devil/fiendish-pacts.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Shira is the demon lord most known for making deals with mortals, and with subterfuge.

She will somehow simultaneously be the most beautiful and second most beautiful lady attending the party at once. She delights in the act of giving mortals exactly what they want, but then taking so much more in return. Her deals will always be carefully worded, often with a written contract. She may misrepresent things and lie to get people to sign, and if they believed her, its their fault for not reading the fine print. These devilish tendencies work to break down society by eroding trust, generating discontent and playing off of the selfish desires of mankind. You didn't honestly expect her help to be free, right dearest?Shira prefers a much more appealing and innocuous form to represent herself. She takes on the form of a voluptuous fox-like beastfolk, appearing mostly human, save for the ears and tail. The only thing that would even indicate she is a demon is vertical pupils of her eyes. When in private company, she has a casual attire she likes involving loose purple clothes, and she lets all nine of her tails out. When working, such as attending parties, she tends to dress exceptionally well and hides all but one of her tails.BoonsT1: Party Animal (Su)

Moogen delights in the constant dance of death that happens all around her as a result of the tasty allure of this lucrative opportunity.Because Moogen is more of a title, rather than a singular creature, the appearance can vary greatly, but a handful of features are passed down. Moogen always has the same type of white eyes with many circles within that seem to spiral and hypnotize.

Many are given tasks to perform, the most popular of which are record keeping and patrolling the halls for those who would steal Hades' treasure or try to escape the Underworld.Particularly strong-willed people are able to resist the pull towards the Styx for a bit longer, and are able to maintain most of their appearance, albeit a bit more ghostly. Creatures that curry favor with Hades are given access to the bodies they had in life and are still privy to many of their core memories.Any and all attempts at resurrection show up on Hades' desk after the fact, and he decides how he wants to approach them on a case by case basis. Acts performed by other gods are out of his control, but noted for future dealings. Every instance of resurrection is considered a debt that must eventually be repayed.

Typically more important memories are more resistant to the power of the Styx: Childhood memories, cherished loved ones, sense of self and important deeds.Starting from the entrance/exit is the precipice. Guarding the exit is the mighty three-headed beast Cerberus, standing as the Underworlds eternal guardian. He freely allows creatures to enter, but never allows them to leave. The precipice largely consists of twisted caves where the River Styx snakes around. Spirits of the dead often linger in the precipice as long as their will allows before inevitably passing through the Styx and washing up in front of Hades' desk. Creatures from the mortal realm wander into the Precipice quite frequently, filling its halls with beasts or mischievous creatures who like to desecrate Hades' altars and commune with lost spirits to lead them astray.

He is known to give blessings and curses in equal measure. Frogg Saran is a very active force in the world of Nack, worming his way into many people's lives whether they like it or not. All this god seeks is to increase the amount of entropy in the universe. His followers start riots and revolutions merely to change the status quo. They reincarnate people for the lulz, just to see the reaction to their new body.Frogg Saran's odd fixation on the rubbery amphibious creature causes frogs to be revered by his followers. Special care should be taken when interacting with any frog or frog-adjacent creature, or risk unwittingly getting dragged into the machinations of this mad god. You never know when what looks like an ordinary frog could be a lunatic, or worse yet, Frogg himself in disguise.The true form of Frogg Saran is unknown, though many suspect his true form is that of a smug frog, save for its eyes are replaced with gnashing maws. It is a common way he appears before mortals, but with other common occurrences being cheese and tentacles, some depict him as an otherworldly aberration, or a rodent..{% hint style="info" %}
Because it is possible to have faith in Frogg with negative wisdom, he never reliably answers prayers. But when he does answer prayers, they are typically in unexpected ways, and tend to be useful in ways other than providing advice.This could mean the place you are looking for suddenly explodes, the handsome fellow you were interested in talking to reveals they are a homosexual, or a frog will lead the way.In any such case, the advice/assistance comes in a much more dramatic and roundabout way.

When you cast reincarnate, you gain access to a random innate technique that you can use once. While you have this technique, you lose access to reincarnation. After you expend the technique, you regain access to reincarnation. See chart below for determining what technique you gain.<br>Using this technique as it is intended, AKA, not using it just to cycle to a new one, gives you 100 GBP. You cannot use this to farm GBP passively during down time. Up to DM interpretation what qualifies as "intended use."

You can expend a use of prayer in order to find out forbidden lore concerning a creature you can see. Choose a random creature within 30 ft of you and then roll serendipity. The higher the roll, the more pertinent the information. This knowledge is always presented in a numerical format such as "2 kings killed" for important/secret high roll info or "0 dogs pet" for low impact knowledge.When you truly believe, you are rewarded. Roll on this chart to see what technique tree, then roll d6 until you get a technique level you have access to. Then roll another dice in a similar method to determine what technique in that tier (something like a d10 should usually suffice).Ex. I roll 12 and get Cataclysm. Then I roll d6 and get 6, but I'm only level 5 and don't have access to tier 6 techniques. I roll d6 again and get a 1. I roll d8 and get a 1, giving me access to the 5G technique.]]></description><link>gods/gods/earthly-deities/frogg-saran.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Gods/gods/earthly-deities/frogg-saran.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[mother-earth]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mother Earth is the god of all things untamed and natural. She is the oldest of all deities. It is said that she was the entity that created the realm of mortals. A piece of her exists inside of all living things. As such, she has no true domain. But there are locations where life is at its most dense that are considered sacred, like lush rain forests, coral reefs and the valleys between forested mountains. Many see Mother Earth as a benevolent force, but she is primarily an entity that seeks balance between sentient creatures and the rest of the world. Many great tragedies have happened to people in the past when mankind overstepped its boundaries: Floods, earthquakes and storms the likes of which the world is better off never seeing again. These stories and their lessons are passed down through those studying under the druidic arts so that way such tragedies can be prevented from happening again.She is often depicted as a resting land mass, the bends of her shoulders, knees and hips creating mountains.

The Garden is commonly used as a place of mediation since all forms of violence are forbidden within the domain of the Shroomlette.The Shroomlette is an entity that represents the bond between gooms, a breed of squishy draconic creatures, and shroomkin, a race of people with close ties to fey creatures and mushrooms.

To do this requires a lot of time and effort to be successful. The bare minimum required in order to conduct the ritual is...
Mana. 100*(creature's lvl)^2. (1=100, 2=400, 3=900...12=14,400)
Proficiency in planes.
The creature's name before it transformed.
With all of the above ingredients, you can draw the magic circles required, power it, and initiate the ritual. The person in charge of performing the ritual rolls a DC 17 luck check to guess the creature's true name: A word in an ancient tongue meant to represent who a person is at the core of their soul. If successful, then it transforms into a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/RMbLojcVzvAZ0Dwd2Vjs/races/hellion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/RMbLojcVzvAZ0Dwd2Vjs/races/hellion" target="_self">hellion</a>. If it fails, it is evaporated, leaving only a silhouette and any of its gear/clothing behind.Because this is such a slim chance of success, and creatures only get one shot, Brazzerian priests have done a great deal of research on how to improve the likelihood of a rituals success. Each of the below things can improve odds, adding additional bonuses to the luck check.
(+1) Double the mana cost. This can stack, but it must be doubled each time.
(+2) Convince the creature to be willing to transform, usually requiring appealing the the creatures ethos.
(Up to +3) Have detailed information on who the creature was in life. Major things, like events they regret, cherished family/friends, major accomplishments contribute more.
(Up to +3) Have items significant to what the creature was in life. Items like childhood treasures, wedding rings and signature weapons/armor contribute more.
(+2) Perform ritual in sanctified area. Such areas are rare instances where Brazzeria has visited the realm of mortals to perform miracles, and are closely guarded treasures.
Other things can add to the bonus that aren't listed here as appropriate.In very rare instances, creatures can be born fiends, such as when they are the child of a demon lord. Such fiends ignore most of the aforementioned rules: They can automatically succeed on the ritual if they are willing, and it always fails if they are not.Their changes tend to be less dramatic, allowing them to maintain most aspects of their fiendish form and powers, making them very rare catches for Brazzerians.]]></description><link>gods/gods/heavenly-deities/brazzeria/brazzerian-purification.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Gods/gods/heavenly-deities/brazzeria/brazzerian-purification.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Her Smoliness the Goddess Brazzeria is the goddess of redemption, often revered by the Hellion her followers create. Brazzeria is unique in that she and her followers can see the good in all but the most depraved of souls. More importantly, they also believe such creatures can be saved. They often form close intimate and personal relationships with people and creatures that many find unsavory. Combine that with their tendency towards acceptance of sexual deviancy and Brazzeria has a mixed reputation.Regardless of what mortals think, the immortal fiends of the world fear Brazzerian priests and priestesses more than anything. Brazzerian missionaries will travel to the fiendish infestations in the world to capture as many as possible for conversion, even traveling into the demon realm itself to keep a steady flow of purification rituals.Brazzeria is depicted as a light-skinned, small catgirl with feathered wings. Her skin typically covered in tattoos of gold and milky yellow. She wears minimal clothing, preferring to wear the coif portion of a nun's habit, and an ill fitting one that allows her golden hair to spill out of it. Outside of that she wears stockings and sleeve warmers, leaving censorship fairies to cover up the rest.BoonsT1: Fiends are Friends (Su)
You get advantage on persuasion checks made against fiends.You can expend a use of prayer to get a general sense of distance and direction of the highest concentration of fiends within 100 miles. This prayer takes 1 minute.By succeeding on a planes check, or touching a fiend, you can tell if its soul/psyche is too shattered to be redeemed. This is most common in monstrous fiends, or amalgamations of souls.T2: Introductions (Su)

You normally cannot take 10 on opposed skill checks. Good for profession and general crafting.Taking 20When not under duress, and with a lot of time on your hands, you can automatically achieve the result of rolling a 20. It takes 20 times as long as the task would normally take. It is also assumed that during this time, you fail several times, making it ill-suited for a situations where there are consequences on a fail (such as smashing a wall or deactivating an explosive).Group Skill ChecksIn certain circumstances, creatures may want to work together perform the same task. If it is something that can tangibly benefit from group effort (pushing over a large boulder, creating a spell etc.), use the bonus of the creature with the highest modifier, then get +1 for each assisting creature and +2 for each assistant creature that is proficient in the task at hand.In other circumstances, you may want to use skills as a group when you need to, even if it less than optimal, such as group stealth with a clumsy heavy armor user. In such scenarios, you use the bonus of the weakest link as though everybody were assisting them.GambitsUsing a rule system inherently poses limitations on the actions that a player can take. The idea of gambits is to let players take their cool ideas and let them play out despite the games mechanics. If your player wants to do something that isn't necessarily covered by the rules (or only vaguely), then it counts as a gambit.The intention behind gambits is to create situations that have incredibly high risk and high reward. Before performing a gambit, the player tosses out a few ideas on how they plan to perform the action and the GM makes suggestions and/or adjustments based on circumstance. The GM should make it clear to the player what their roundabout odds are for completing a given gambit.Benefits for performing a gambit can include things like not taking fall damage with a plunging attack, gaining extra movement by swinging on things through danger or surviving otherwise deadly circumstances.Drawbacks for failing when attempting a gambit can include things like being CC'd, losing poise, losing hp or having their actions interrupted and made impossible. In extreme cases if players do something very silly, like jumping up cliffs or battling forces of nature, they may accumulate afflictions, or other long lasting debuffs.]]></description><link>nicknack-skills/general-thoughts/other-skill-rules.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">nicknack SKILLS/general-thoughts/other-skill-rules.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[example-dcs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Common modifiers to make the task more difficult can include…

What you know. Knowledge is broken up into many different skills based on subject and each one has a subsection dedicated to monster lore of specific types of creatures. Monster lore isn’t its own skill, but it has its own functions separate from the rest of individual knowledge skills. If a subject or creature falls into multiple categories, then players can choose whichever they like more, but an individual character can't roll multiple checks with different skills.{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to know who an individual creature is and their relevance to the world, rather than their stats and abilities, the DC is usually dependent on how popular they are. Typically (22-lvl) with additional reductions to the DC if they are famous, or in a position of power. This could also include increases to the DC if they work to keep their identity and exploits hidden, or live remotely.
{% endhint %}Monster LoreAdventurers are assumed to know basic things about monsters, like how constructs lack of anatomy grant them resistance to many effects or the properties of incorporeal creatures. Monster lore checks are for figuring out more information about specific monsters. Monster stat blocks are broken up into sections. Basic stats (saves, HP and AC), offense traits (breath weapons, dangerous auras, prominent spells), defense traits (healing abilities, elemental resistances), other traits (extra senses, extra movement options, out of combat abilities) and weaknesses/deep lore (lich's phylactery, vampires not appearing in mirrors). Rolling a monster lore check is something you can do as a free action once per turn. It is assumed that you also vocalize what you learn to your team. The base DC of a monster lore check is (10+creature's lvl). By succeeding on a monster lore check, you can figure out a creature's basic stats and one other category. Every 5 over the DC you roll, you figure out another category. If a creature has nothing in a category, you choose another.Creatures with the [unique] tag in their entry increase monster lore DC by 5. Humanoids with class levels by default are assumed to have the [unique] tag.{% tabs %}

{% endhint %}Skill rolls are how players interact with the world without hitting it with their sword. Even if certain actions have a skill associated with them, you don't necessarily need to roll a skill check (no need to roll deception if they already believe you, no need to roll athletics in still water, etc). When one is required, it is prompted by the DM. D20 can be very swingy, creating dramatically unexpected results. That is its strong suite. As such using a skill roll as a barrier for entry can create all or nothing scenarios. There's nothing wrong with saying "the lock is too complex for you to pick," but you can't be upset when immediately after the martials of the party start smashing into the door. Just like with attack rolls and saving throws, there should be lesser versions of success. If you barely fail the DC to scale a wall, it lowers your speed instead of falling. If you barely fail a stealth check while trailing someone, they can tell someone is in the bushes, but not who. Skill bonuses by default only use the relevant ability modifier. Proficiency in a skill grants you a 2+(lvl) bonus to the skill. Certain aspects of a skill might only be available to characters that are proficient in the skill and are denoted with a (P)
When you have multiple spells and/or items that give bonuses to skills, only take the highest bonus.Standard skill DCs are what should be used in the absence of a set or opposed DC. They are as follows… Some skills are opposed to other skills, while other skills will include examples comparable this chart.]]></description><link>nicknack-skills/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">nicknack SKILLS/README.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[bestial-boons]]></title><link>races/races/beastfolk/bestial-boons.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Races/races/beastfolk/bestial-boons.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[The furry race.{% tabs %}

Now you can choose your race based on what features you want. Bring out the jacked fairies and the clumsy elves!Most races have a racial language, but also know common.
All creatures are assumed to have a base speed of 30ft.Keep in mind a lot of the lore I use to describe races is used to differentiate a given race from the others. I personally don’t appreciate when elves are just long pretty people. I also make it to give people a starting point if they don't know how to roleplay or world build with a specific race.The descriptions you find here (or in any source really) are specifically tailored to a setting, or are the brain child of some other fantasy obsessed weirdo. They do not need to match how a specific race exists in your world if you have something else in mind.For example...
In the world I built my Lore around, Nack, elves primarily live in a continent known as "The Land of Storms" which has an absurdly high level of rainfall. As such, they developed a spell to combat it called Umbrella, which Elves often inherently learn, separate from any additional magic training. Doesn't make much sense for a subterranean elf now does it?{% hint style="danger" %}
Races very often offer skill bonuses. Skill bonuses from race do not stack unless the two features are a pair of minor and major features. So you couldn't pick goblin and get perception from mixed blood elf's "nice ears" for instance.The only exception to this is if the skill bonuses only apply to specific circumstances, such as a cyborgs sentinel build.

You can roll a few times to decide a few unusual features, decide you want a specific number of each feature, then roll a few d20s, or not roll at all.Depending on the race, some of the features described as weird or negative may actually be positive or completely normal. Some features may be completely absent from your race. An easy way to create a new negative feature is to completely remove or damage certain features (one eye).Feel free to go down the whole list if you're a mad lad (though the ladies might not appreciate some of the hair options)]]></description><link>random-charts/character-creation/abnormalities.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Random Charts/character-creation/abnormalities.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[age]]></title><description><![CDATA[Roll a d100.

At any point while bubble buddy exists, you can send it into a social situation. People will generally treat bubble buddy as a real person, but it does not speak much back, only communicating vaguely through subtle item interactions. Over the course of a minute, bubble buddy will quickly inconvenience people to show what a bad possible outcome is for interacting with this specific person or type of person. Such as spilling a dwarf's drink, or poking someone very sensitive to touch.If you allow it, bubbly buddy will continue interacting with people all around a social setting, such as a party, a tavern etc and ruin the mood. After which, people will turn on the buddy (and the caster if they saw you cast it, see you concentrating etc).]]></description><link>techniques/magical-techniques/goomshroom/level-1/copy-of-bubble-buddy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Techniques/magical-techniques/goomshroom/level-1/copy-of-bubble-buddy.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[gang-up]]></title><description><![CDATA[You create 3 slimy copies of yourself that relentlessly follow a creature of your choosing (even into areas you couldn’t go, such as into the air).

This means the mirror realm can capture entire rooms, including things that are hidden from line of sight (such as behind furniture) This allows your extradimensional space to contain furniture for instance.No effects can come in or out of the mirror realm, but both sides can see what is on the other side of the mirror, barring any kind of physical obstructions that would prevent sight (such as drapery). By tapping on the mirror from either side you can cause the noise to carry over.On casting the spell you can include a password that needs to be spoken in order to walk into the mirror (no action). This password can be changed with 1 minute of concentration from the caster. You can also update the mirror's appearance to keep it inconspicuous should the environment change drastically. The caster can go blind and deaf temporarily to project their senses into the mirror realm at will indefinitely.Objects cannot be brought out, nor can objects be brought in aside from what the average humanoid can reasonably carry on their person. Any such objects left behind are shunted out, along with any creatures, if the mirror is destroyed or the spell ends.Can be made permanent using 2,000g worth of powdered rare metals as an addition material component during castingWhen casting the trapping form, you must target a creature AND an appropriately sized mirror (both of which need to be in range of you, but not each other). If the creature fails its save, it is immediately sucked into the mirror (with a similar setting as the aforementioned hosteling effect). No other creature can enter the mirror realm without another casting of this spell.This does not prevent it from taking actions, but it can no longer interact with anything outside of the mirror realm, nor can any creature interact with the trapped individual. The target is stranded. They can see out of the mirror by standing next to it. The only way they can escape is by having an ally destroy the mirror, or by waiting for 1 minute. In either case, the creature appears in a random space within 15 feet of the mirror's line of sight.]]></description><link>techniques/magical-techniques/larella/level-3/mirror-realm.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Techniques/magical-techniques/larella/level-3/mirror-realm.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><link>techniques/magical-techniques/larella/level-3/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Techniques/magical-techniques/larella/level-3/README.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[telekinetic-lift]]></title><description><![CDATA[You exert your psychic power to manipulate heavy unattended objects within the spells range.

The spell can get very precise in its ability to alter memories, allowing you to remove specific items or creatures, but otherwise maintain everything else. The cast time of the spell is equal to the amount of memory that you want to change. 2 minutes of fighting you want to erase? 2 minutes of concentration.For alterations that total longer than 5 minutes (including multiple strings of casts around the same time), the creature will fight to remember things that were altered or removed.

The magic of the realms themselves bestowed the royalty of the ruling class, with the Queen and King at the top being given unique wisdom and strength with which to lead their people.The secrets to their magic were closely guarded by the royal family until the last King was murdered in a foreign adversary's coup attempt, and the princess at the time mysteriously disappeared for months. When she returned to take the throne back, she made the secrets of the Moon Queen's Wisdom public knowledge, but the secrets to the Moon King's Strength was forever lost when the Moon Princess died without providing the Lunar Realms a new heir.These spells are based upon the Moon Queen's Wisdom. They focus on abilities passed down from the stars themselves that grant foresight, prosperity, retribution, and access to the ebb and flow of magic from heavenly bodies. Many lunar spells deal force damage and have delayed benefits.Some Lunar spells require access to the night sky.]]></description><link>techniques/magical-techniques/lunar/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Techniques/magical-techniques/lunar/README.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[dark-lure]]></title><description><![CDATA[A nearly invisible whip of shadows emerges from your staff and wraps around a target.

The size of what you create is limited to a 5x5x5 ft cube, but other than that, there are few limitations. You can create a fire, and it (seems to) gives off heat. You can create a dog and it bounces around in its space and barks. You can create a door that creaks as it swings on its broken hinges.When you initially cast the spell, you decide a type of behavior that your imaginary creation exhibits. Maybe you want your person that you made to dance, but then the party you're at the music stops. You can spend a standard action concentrating on the spell (as long as you have line of sight to your imagination) to have it change behaviors to instead bow before a king. You cannot change what you imagine, but you can change what your imagination does.Your imagination isn't limited to the laws of physics, so you can have it do incredibly unusual things, like having a person swim through air or a rock doing flips. However, when creatures see unusual stimuli like that, they get a save to disbelieve it. If someone points out it’s a fake, other creatures automatically see through it and it appears translucent to them.When used in combat, creatures may waste their time attacking the imaginary creature, but instead of rolling attacks or the imagination rolling saves, the attacking creature rolls a save. Failed saves indicate they miss or the creature resists the attack. Passed saves indicate they see through the ruse, and they can communicate this to their allies, making them automatically disbelieve it, causing the illusion appear translucent to all.The "concentration" part of the duration allows you to indefinitely maintain this imagination as long as you concentrate each turn as a standard action. You must have line of sight to the imagination to concentrate on it. If you do not concentrate on the spell for 1 minute, it disappears.Upcast - Each additional mana you spend increases the dimensions by 5 ft on all sides, to a max of 4 mana and 20x20x20 dimensions. By spending 5 mana, the duration also changes to permanent, no longer requiring concentration. Dispel magic automatically succeeds against permanent imaginations. ]]></description><link>techniques/magical-techniques/moogen/level-1/imagination.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Techniques/magical-techniques/moogen/level-1/imagination.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[living-shadow]]></title><description><![CDATA[Your shadow detaches and forms a copy of you in your current space.

As long as you concentrate, you can continue to make these innocuous shadow puppets for entertainment and such. Any creature proficient in arcana immediately gets a check to identify the spell (DC 17) if they can see the puppet show.At any point (including immediately when you cast the spell) you can cause the shadows to come to life and take a bite or otherwise attack a creature. Even if you play with the shadows a bit and delay the attack, it still requires a standard action. The creature takes 3d8+CL (13+CL) slash or pierce damage and is frightened for one round (will halves damage and negates frightened).If a creature successfully identifies the spell during a show and either they are the target or they warn the creature that is, they get advantage on their saving throw. If the creature is unaware of the danger the shadow puppets hold and they are the target of the spell later, they have disadvantage on their saving throw. Both of these situations can only happen if the caster chooses to delay the negative effects of the spell.{% hint style="info" %}
Tl;dr - You can cast the spell as a standard to play with shadows or attack. If you decided to play with the shadows for a bit, you must still spend a standard action to use the attack. Playing with the shadows can just be for flavor, or it can be a risky method to enhance its power against those not trained in arcana.

Special: This spell can only be cast while the caster is deprived of a standard action or otherwise unable to cast spells.
{% endhint %}You temporarily and partially negate CC on yourself and nearby creatures. For creatures who are stunned, dazed, in stasis, in time out etc. This spell does not end the cc, but it allows creatures who are affected by them to do anything that could reasonably be considered "not mechanically beneficial" such as singing, dancing, juggling (unless these actions could somehow be mechanically beneficial) or casting a Nack spell. This does not allow movement, attacks, defensive features etc that you would normally be deprived of. This is a meme. If you try to anyway, you are put in time out until combat ends.Any creature in range, regardless if they are CC'd, adds extra flair in all their actions, or emotes like they're in a video game.

Special: Nack spells cannot be learned via technique points. They can only be learned by finding books containing their knowledge.

{% endhint %}Nack is a mysterious mage who uses his mastery in order to create mostly useless and niche magic. He also has enough free time to hide these books all over the world in secluded places. Very few of the spells are as powerful as one might expect of a mage, but they are usually interesting, quirky and fun. A mage with mastery over Nack spells is not more powerful because of it, but they're probably more fun to have at parties.]]></description><link>techniques/magical-techniques/nack/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Techniques/magical-techniques/nack/README.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[blight]]></title><description><![CDATA[You briefly allow a creature to experience the joy of decomposition.

In general the staff component serves much the same function no matter its shape, but there are some small differences.Staves - Staves are usually long and sturdy pieces of wood. Most of the magical components of the staff are attached to the end of it. Staves can universally be used as weapons.Seals - Seals have an enormous amount of variety to them. But they are typically compact: Some small handheld object, often of spiritual significance. Seals are ineffective unless they are the only thing occupying the hand.Wands - Wands are usually small pieces of wood about in the rough shape of a pencil, but usually a bit larger. Wands usually come pre-built in with a cantrip.Other sufficiently magical things can potentially be used as magical foci with their own unique benefits such as books giving access to more spells.

CL determines the effectiveness of many spells.This stat is also relevant in resolving what happens when casting goes head to head with each other (such as with dispel magic), when using healing to staunch bleeding or when light and darkness magic meet. If dual wielding staff components, get +1 CL.Spell FailureBy default, spells have a 100% chance of being cast, but certain things can cause spell failure. When spell failure causes your spell to fail, the resource used to cast it is consumed. A spell failing is usually shortened to "fizzles."Combining Magic EffectsMany spells give you some kind of buff, or generate some kind of persistent effect. You can only have one type of each of the following effects active at once.[Concentration]
An effect with the concentration tag requires some degree of upkeep from the user and typically has a duration. Things like wall spells and summons have the concentration tag.[Buff]
An ability with the buff tag grants a boon to the creature it is applied to (and not necessarily the user). A creature can only have one effect with the buff tag active at once. Buffs can only be cast on willing creatures.WeatherCertain high level spells manipulate the weather in drastic ways. If multiple casters attempt to cast different spells that affect the weather, the creature with the higher CL always wins.In the event where the caster tries to interfere with weather that is supernaturally powerful (created by a complex ritual, associated with cursed terrain etc), the DM should assign the effect an effective CL.All weather inducing spells do not function underground.]]></description><link>techniques/technique-rules/spell-mechanics/other-magic-rules.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Techniques/technique-rules/spell-mechanics/other-magic-rules.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Spellcasting is a general title that applies to a specific type of magical effect, with specific rules.

This section is dedicated to techniques. Techniques use a point system to represent how invested you are in a specific technique, from 1 to 6.Techniques are often things that you use in combat, such as special attacks and spells.MemoryWhen you have technique points invested in a specific style, you can prepare any of the techniques of the tier you have unlocked. Memory determines how many techniques you can have prepared or "memorized" at any given time and thus what you can use on a dime.All techniques are assumed to take 1 memory unless stated otherwise.Special attacks from items/class/etc and cantrips to not require memory.Using Multiple Techniques a TurnTechniques can be any kind of action, leading them to be able to be used twice, maybe even more times a turn. Techniques are not balanced in such a way to be allowed to freely use some of your most powerful abilities multiple times a turn.Therefore there is an inherent limit tied to techniques. You can only use up to 2 levels of techniques at level 1, 3 at level 3, 4 at level 5 etc, increasing by 1 every 2 levels and capping at 7 by level 11. This essentially limits you to using level 1 techniques in tandem with your most powerful available techniques. This limit even applies to innate techniques, however there is a small exception. Sometimes you may receive some incredible boon, or a monster might have a technique a bit higher than their level might suggest. In such cases, no additional techniques can be used in the same turn as this high level technique.Innate Casting/TechniquesSome techniques can be granted outside of the standard progression, such as things gained from race, class, magic item, specialized training, or some kind of boon granted by another creature. Usually quite limited in scope and much more common on monsters.Innate techniques do not take up memory slots and are always memorized.Innate techniques grant creatures the ability to use a specific set of techniques. Spells do not require the staff/seal component that other casting typically requires. If a spell has a material or focus component, that is also ignored with innate casting. By default, creatures with innate techniques can use their techniques an unlimited number of times. Number values are included next to techniques that have limited uses per day.Mana burn still applies to innately casted spells. But otherwise they cost no mana.If a spell is constant, the spell is persistently active on the creature and takes up its buff slot. A new buff can be cast on it, rendering the constant spell inactive. If its constant spell is deactivated, it can reactivate it as a swift action.Technique ProgressionIn general, classes get access to a few technique trees. Techniques are separated into six levels, requiring 6 points of investment in order to reach the highest tier.At every even level, you get a technique point you can invest in any form of technique. For every point you invest, you get access to a new level of technique. There are some limitations. You cannot invest all of your technique points into the techniques your class specializes in to get access to high level abilities extremely early. Technique levels have a hard character level requirement, as shown below… Techniques are also separated into two different general categories: martial and magic. Each class typically has a specialization in either one of these categories.Martial/Magical SpecializationWith martial specialization, you automatically gain points in warfare equal to the highest level of investment you have in martial techniques (ex. Have barbarism 3? You also have warfare 3).Magical specialization as a baseline gives you access to cantrips. You know 6 cantrips. You do not need to spend memory in order to prepare cantrips.
You automatically gain points in wild card equal to the highest level of investment you have in magical techniques (ex. Have pyromancy 3? You also have wild card 3).UpcastMy spending additional mana, you can increase the effectiveness of the technique. Some techniques scale per additional mana spent and others require thresholds to get completely new effects.
You can only ever spend 6 mana on a technique.]]></description><link>techniques/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Techniques/README.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[+Class]]></title><description><![CDATA[Classes are the fundamental basis from which you obtain abilities.Classes get a set of numerical bonuses to aid them.

You do not need to opt into an achievement, instead they can be claimed retroactively after accomplishing a task.Battle ScarsRequirement - Get defeated by a critical hit and survive in 3 different encounters. Or get crit 3 times in the same combat and survive.Reward - The scars you get from battle are deeply entrenched in your memory. Your memories of combats you have encountered cannot be magically removed.
By touching them, you can perfectly recall past events, as long as they happened in the thick of combat. Other creatures can touch your scars to share in the experience of the memoryBackstabberRequirement - Murder 3 people you once considered allies, or who at thought you were an ally (before you turned on them). If you murder someone in a position of great power, like a powerful guild leader or king, it counts as 3.Reward - You have a 6th sense for when people trust you. By observing how they react to your presence in a brief interaction (such as an introduction), you can tell whether they trust you, are indifferent towards you or if they distrust you.Critical PetRequirement - Use stealth to initiate combat on a creature by patting its head 3 times. This pat can have no mechanical effect such as delivering a spell or attacking.Reward - You unlock the "Pet" skill, usable for memes. It uses your stealth bonus. If you sneak up on a creature and pet their head (again, no additional mechanical effect), you establish dominance, giving you a +2 bonus to skills for the subsequent social or combat encounter. If a creature within reach is smaller than you, you can pet them as a free action 1/turn for no mechanical benefit (no save).]]></description><link>classes/+class-details/+ligma/achievements.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/+Class Details/+ligma/achievements.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[progression-outside-of-class]]></title><description><![CDATA[Just so its all in one place.Boons/Banes - Gained at level one as a result of having positive or negative luck.Feats - Gained at level 1, and every odd level after.Technique Points - Gain one that can be used on any school of techniques at level 2, and every even level after.Ascendance - Unique template applied at level 12.Achievements - Can be gained at any time, even retroactively, when certain conditions are met, varying based on the achievement]]></description><link>classes/+class-details/+ligma/progression-outside-of-class.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/+Class Details/+ligma/progression-outside-of-class.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[class-descriptions-completion-status]]></title><description><![CDATA[This section primarily exists to give you a starting point to see what you're interested in.Because this is early access, not all the classes are done

Poise determines how difficult you are to toss around. It functions similarly to hp, but you subtract the attack roll from the target's poise. If this reduces them to 0 poise, they suffer the effects of the maneuver and their poise resets to maximum. Poise naturally resets after combat ends or by taking the total defense action. Other effects that toss characters around might also interact with poise. If poise is reduced via lowered stats without a combat maneuver being used, it drops to a minimum of 1 (unless otherwise specified).Using a combat maneuver replaces melee attacks by default.Poise is calculated as follows. Common things like armor, shields and feats add to poise. All bonuses to poise stack.10 + (level) + (strength) + (dexterity) + (armor/shields) + (class) + (etc)Any damage reduction also applies to poise damage.<br>Combat maneuvers by default have the <a data-href="Martial" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/martial.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Martial</a> tag, allowing you to use the attack, damage and bonus effects of a held weapon or natural attack, even if it states you use another attack form.]]></description><link>core-rules,-how-to-play/abbreviations-and-terminology/poise.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Rules, How to Play/Abbreviations and Terminology/Poise.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 18:09:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Advantage]]></title><description><![CDATA[There are many abilities in the game that allow you additional odds success in some limited capacity.

You can fashion a prosthetic limb or organ fitted to a specific creature's needs. When inserted or attached, the organ assumes normal functionality, albeit with some getting used to. Limbs inflict clumsy 1 and organs inflict sickened 1. These debuffs cannot be removed and persist for 1 week. At the end of the week, the limbs are indistinguishable from the originals, leaving only connecting scar tissue.

Using alchemical inspiration, a laboratory, 1,000g of materials and 1 minute of time...
Limbs/organs you replace do not apply debuffs
<br>You can reverse the effects of a <a data-href="reincarnation" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">reincarnation</a> spell, returning the creature to its previous form.
If a creature is corrupted but not yet completely consumed by some malicious force, such as a creature part way through transforming into a fiend, you can reverse the direction of this corruption. Over time after administering your solution, the creature reverts back to its old self, assuming it does not continue to actively corrupt further.
Anything reasonably close to these abilities in terms of power/effect
What counts as "corruption" is intentionally left vague, because alchemists are supposed to break rules, not be bound by them. In fantasy, any number of things can "corrupt" for greater power or as a consequence of associating with evil. You can counter the GM bullshit if you manage to capture corrupted allies or save otherwise unwilling enemies.Using alchemical inspiration, a laboratory, 1 rare materials and 1 minute of time you can restore a creature back from anything short of death.A rare material is again, intentionally vague, because its not an item that exists in the game, but is something that should exist in the world. These ingredients should be extracted from creatures that have incredible restorative properties, are immortal or something similar.

This section should help provide guidelines for not only the types of things you should be thinking about studying for your alchemist, but also the power of the mechanical effects.In general, majors can be separated into a few categories.The main thing that you should be focusing on for your major is thinking about a completely unique thing that your character specializes in. It should be specific and limited in scope.Idea Phase:
"I specialize in transforming into animals" is a bit too vague and is too similar to the shapeshifter class. If we are on the cutting edge of new techniques, we want something that isn't just another class's features."I specialize in grafting beast parts to people" is more specific, and falls more closely in line with what you imagine a fantasy scientist would do. For me at least, it's easy to imagine Frankenstein's monster type alchemist that has slowly replaced his body with more optimal animal parts to become a completely unique creature.Mechanics Phase:
Sticking with the idea of grafting animal parts, this idea lends itself well to an enhancer type play style. You might gather the parts during your adventures by purchasing them or killing the beasts yourself, but gaining benefits requires work you do ahead of time.Crafting rules are elsewhere, where you can find how long it takes, how much it cost and how difficult it should be. Right now we are concerned with the mechanics. What should a grafted part do? Considering you are fusing parts onto yourself you could give yourself noteworthy parts from other animals to gain permanent abilities: Dog nose for scent, bull horns for a natural attack, fins and gills for aquatic adventures. Considering you're replacing your humanoid parts, there might also be some drawbacks. Lion claws aren't the best for grasping things like opposable thumbs are, for example.An ability like this can open up opportunities for limitless power as long as you keep pouring resources into it, so it should also have some hard limitation. Limiting yourself to only mixing and matching 3 parts for example. Considering the mechanical effect is similar, perhaps use shapeshifter's point system as a basis for how powerful the individual parts can be.Thesis marks the point where few have developed their research to this point. This should be the point where you start bending rules and creating increasingly ridiculous items with your craft.Continuing with the idea of grafting animal parts, this is where you might add a second tier to your crafting. No longer are you just replacing parts, but you can add completely new ones, doing things like turning people into centaurs of all kinds of creatures, giving yourself an additional limb, maybe an extra beast head.Up the limit of how many parts you can give a creature, so long as they are willing to accept tier 2 augmentations.Grand discovery marks the point where only the best, brightest and most insane push their research to the boundaries of what should be possible. This is the point where you should be breaking rules and doing things once only thought imaginary.By combining different animal parts from dead creatures, you can create entirely new creatures. You can make alterations to yourself to make you completely unrecognizable from when you began. Once upon a time you were a man. Now you are a massive spider from the waist down allowing you to climb any surface with ease, your torso is covered in thick chitin to protect your vitals, your head is covered in beady eyes to allow you to see in all directions.]]></description><link>classes/alchemist/major/alchemist-majors.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/alchemist/Major/Alchemist Majors.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:45:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[boomkin]]></title><description><![CDATA[You have created a fragile companion meant to run in, tank some hits, and go out in a blaze of glory.

Miss an attack or fail to break a creatures poise
Fail an opposed skill check
Increase the poise damage you deal and your athletics bonus by your stacks of wrath.You can only maintain wrath while not wearing armor and only during combat, or other minigames like arm wrestling contests and chases. You cannot accumulate/maintain wrath when you are not in such a scenario.{% hint style="info" %}
I'm not a lawyer, so my writing is probably not without loopholes. The basic idea is to only accumulate wrath in dramatic situations.

They play songs that intimidate, fascinate and confound their enemies. Their finales are all about finishing the combat once and for all.Removes inspiration.Blues bards have the bardic performance ability, but with a few key differences. Their performances vary in action type, with some of the more powerful performances requiring a standard action to begin. They can only ever affect enemies with their performances.
Creatures get a new save to end performances at the end of each turn (but not finales). Some performances, like inspire doom and the blues, have no save.
Once a creature passes its save against a performance, it becomes completely immune to that particular performance type for 1 hour. They get advantage on saves against other performances.
Status effects from performance immediately end when a creature is no longer in the aura, allowing enemies to just leave, or push the bard away. This does not trigger the immunity/resistance to performance listed above.
Action: Swift
Enemies take a -2 penalty to attack and saves against fear effects.Action: Swift
Enemies treat the area of the performance as difficult terrain. This performance is unaffected by high note.Make an attack with a +10 bonus. You can also perform a special attack or technique that involves an attack (including a spell attack) with this finale.Roast your enemies, causing them to falter when it matters most. As an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 ft to subtract a d6 to a d20 roll (minus luck checks). At level 6 this increases to d8. At level 10 this improves to d10.This ability can be used once per minute. You can ignore the recharge time and use it again if you [mana burn] 2.Action: Standard
Enemies are fascinated (will negates). When used in combat, creatures get a new save at the end of each turn.Enemies are confused until they get an "act normally result."You can gather a crowd of commoners in a settlement and cause them to riot over a specific topic. They grab their pitchforks and torches and start marching to burn something down, kill a scourge to society or something similar. You must continue this performance and lead them to maintain their fervor.A creature outside of the crowd can attempt a persuasion roll (against the Blues Bard's DC with disadvantage) if they can get loud enough to be heard by the crowd. Once this persuasion check is successful, the crowd disperses. If the persuader beats your DC by 5, the crowd turns on you.This doesn't have much practical use in combat unless there happens to be a large quantity of commoners in the area.Action: Standard
Enemies are frightened (will negates).The power of your music is too intense, and everybody must dance to it. Your enemies are stunned (will negates). ]]></description><link>classes/bard/bard-of-the-blues.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/bard/bard-of-the-blues.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[cheerleader]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cheerleader bards excel at bringing their allies up when times are the toughest with encouraging words and healing effects.

Their performances vary in action type, with some of the more powerful performances requiring a standard action to begin. They can only ever effect enemies with their performances.
The cheerleader only ever gets a singular performance, and allies can choose to gain any one benefit from the performance, deciding at the start of their turn. Below are level requirements for providing a particular benefit.1 - Raise Morale - Increase allied speed by 10 and give them advantage on saves against fear1 - Inspire Courage - +2 attack4 - Song of [Healing] - Restore 3 hp.1 - Raise Dongers - ???A cheerleader can use the aid action as a swift action.

These technique points can be used on the shroomlette, moogen or shira trees.Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips.You get proficiency in the profession (musician) skill and a +4 bonus to all related checks. You can use this profession skill to make history checks. When you make a history check using profession, you need to spend 1 minute to sing the song while playing an instrument to jog your memory.You can make these checks and generate music without an instrument by making the required movements, but you take a -4 penalty. Doing so always takes at least one hand to perform.You can use instruments as the staff component to your spell casting, but you cannot use imaginary instruments.With a week of downtime, you can create a new song and spread it across the land. The take away of a song can usually boil down to into a single phrase such as "the forest houses a dangerous witch" or "Ragnar the Red has been slain." Most messages tend to catch on quickly, unless they directly oppose common sentiments or are outright lies: The aforementioned examples wouldn’t work well if the witch is friendly or Ragnar is still kicking.The overall effect of the song is to affect the general sentiment towards specific topics or to diffuse basic information. For example, you could spread heroic tales of your adventure to let people know a deadly beast is dead. A dangerous cult could be lurking in a city and you warn the people to avoid people with a specific symbol on them.When you replace songs using your companion slots, they might not be the talk of the town anymore, being regularly performed on the streets, but they might not be forgotten. If you do a large scale organized event in the area where your song is a hit, you can make one last perform check to see if it sticks for good. See below for DCs.The distance this song spreads is dependent on your level.As a swift action, play an instrument to start a performance for 1 minute. After the minute passes or after using a finale, you cannot activate bardic performance again for 1 minute.Performances affect all creatures within 30 ft of you, specifying either allies or enemies. You can change the type of performance that you're doing as a swift action. A creature that steps within the radius of a performance, gains its benefit/penalties for one round, even if it only exists in it briefly.As a standard action, you can immediately end your performance to perform some kind of powerful action called a finale. Any allies that are within the area of your bardic performance before you perform your finale still gain its benefit for that round.The types of performances and finales a bard has is based on archetype.When you succeed on a save against a charm effect, the creature who inflicted it is charmed by you for the effects usual duration.By burning 1 mana as an immediate action, you can allow a creature within 30 ft to add d4 to a d20 roll (minus luck checks).

If you pass a reflex save, it deals no damage and has no other additional effect.When an attack misses you, or when you pass a saving throw, you can move 15 ft as an instant action [elusive].You can slow the falling of up to four creatures within 30 ft of each other or in a 10x10 area as an immediate action. This negates fall damage they take and lets them land on their feet.As long as you maintain a (mostly) shaved head, you gain blindsense (tremorsense 5ft). It treats open air as though it was water.Creature within 30 ft takes blast damage and is made frosty or entangled (reflex halves dmg and negates status). Athletics to escape entangle as a swift action. 1 fire damage frees the creature automatically.Whenever you use your elemental wave feature, creatures are made clumsy 1 on a failed save.
When you land your elemental blast, creatures are clumsy 1.Remove the mana cost of elemental wave.
Creatures that fail their save against your elemental wave are pushed away from you or pulled towards you 10 ft (your choosing for all affected creatures).By falling 30 ft and landing on the ground after jumping into the air or flying, you can cannonball as a standard action. Creatures within 20 ft of you take you're blast damage and are knocked to the edge of the AoE (fort halves damage and negates pushback). Until the start of your next turn, get +4 ac vs ranged attacks.When you take flight, enemies within 10 feet of you become clumsy 1.Ride inside of a wheel shaped air current through the battlefield as a FRA. Move 40 feet using your hover speed without provoking AoOs. Any creature whose space you move through takes blast damage and is knocked down (reflex halves damage and negates knock down).You permanently memorize aqueous orb (Shroomlette 3) without spending memory. If it originates from a body of water, your CL is increased by 2.Air within 30 ft rapidly starts to spiral, carrying anything within. Creatures within the area are immediately caught in the whirlwind (fort negates, putting them out of the AoE at nearest point). When the creature is caught, and every round thereafter, they take your blast damage and are thrown around in a very random fashion (roll dice to determine which side they end up on).Each round a creature can attempt an athletics check as a FRA to escape the whirlwind's area.You are immune to the effects of your own whirlwind.Pull the air directly out of the lungs of a creature within 30 ft. The creature is staggered for 1 minute. Each round at the end of their turn for the next minute they gain a stack of doom (fort negates). At 3 stacks they gain the defeated condition for 10 minutes and the airbender can choose to end the effect.As a standard action you can encase yourself in powerful winds, forming a powerful barrier for 1 minute.

In a 60 ft cone in front of you, or a 120 ft line, each 30 ft tall (pushing or pulling), unleash a current that automatically deals your blast damage to any creature in its area or any creature that walks into the area. Creatures that take blast damage are launched outside of the areas aoe in the direction you chose (fort negates). Creatures not knocked away by the effect still treat the area is difficult terrain.

If you want to hover while it is not your turn, it has the [concentration] tag.When you move at least 30 feet on your turn, attacks have 20% miss chance against you until the start of your next turn. Creatures that miss you with attacks as a result of this become clumsy 1.I usually go "high roll leads to best result" for these types of features, so a 9 or 10 on a d10.You can physically manipulate air within 30 ft. Unlike water and earth, air cannot create structures, nor can it lift enormous quantities of matter. You can manipulate unattended objects weighing up to (10*lvl) lbs, moving them anywhere within range, including into your hands. Like with all bending, it rewards creativity and allows you to do anything gusts of wind could reasonably do, like allowing you to jump as high and far as you can move automatically or slowing the fall of creatures in a 10x10 area.Initiating and maintaining concentration on air bending requires a standard action each turn.You've learned how to utilize gliding technology to allow you to fly. A glider requires 50g of wood and canvas and 8 hours to make. You gain a fly speed equal to your speed while using this glider. If the glider is sundered, you cannot use it to fly. Using a glider requires one hand.Jumping using airbending no longer requires concentration.By spending a standard action to concentrate each turn, you can fly by creating a whirlwind underneath you, even without a glider. You are limited to flying 30 ft high like this. Each round you concentrate to fly like this you also remove all clumsy stacks.You do not provoke AoOs by taking flight. When you fly you take no penalty to speed for flying up at a 45 degree or higher angle and can do so while clumsy. When flying you are capped at clumsy 2. If you take flight while clumsy 3 or higher, it decreases to clumsy 2.When a creature gets clumsy as a result of wind stance, they also take 15 poise damage.When you are flying at least 15 ft higher than a creature, you get +2 attack against them.You can fly without the aid of gliding technology.

Can also be used to defend an ally touching the ground within 30 ft of you.You can walk along any surface primarily consisting of earth without penalty, even along walls and ceilings, though it is considered difficult terrain. If poise broken, you plummet and take appropriate fall damage.
You can start concentrating on this ability as a free action. If you concentrate as a standard action, you can move at full speed, and cannot be knocked off when poise broken.Increase your jump distance by 10 feet.
You can give an ally a jump action as an immediate action by spending 1 mana. they also receive this boost.Your burrow speed increases to 30 the first turn you start burrowing. By spending 1 mana, you can make an explosive entry, giving your next melee attack gets a +2 bonus if you burrowed that turn.Cause a 30 ft long, 10 ft wide, 30 ft deep chasm to appear in a spot on the ground, the starting point needs to be within your natural reach. Creatures inside the AoE fall inside and take appropriate fall damage (reflex negates). A creature can opt to use athletics as an immediate action instead of their reflex save. A creature that's successfully saves can choose which side of the chasm they end up on.At any point thereafter, you can close the fissure as a standard action, crushing anybody inside.

This also negates your fall damage.As a swift action, you can use earthbending to create terrain that lasts until the end of your turn, or until the end of your next turn. This can be used to make things like bridges, ramps and stairs or cover to avoid an AoO.Cause a creature within 30 ft to sink into the earth.

Two of their arms (or similar limbs) become completely unusable and they drop whatever is in their hands (reflex reduces to one arm, their choice). Athletics as a swift action to break bindings.

If you are successful, you can redirect it as though you had cast it, using your class DC. If you fail, you become the target (or center of the effect).Launch an immense fire blast into the sky, the center of which lands on a space within 120 ft of you. Creatures within 5 ft of the impact zone have disadvantage on their save. Deal blast damage in a 40 ft radius and set all creatures ablaze (reflex halves damage and negates ablaze). The meteor's AoE sets creatures that walk through it ablaze (reflex negates).You smash the ground violently, and magma pours from the impact, rapidly filling a 20 ft radius around you with magma rapidly. Creatures in the initial area of the spell take blast damage and have lava cling to them (reflex halves dmg and negates lava cling). Creatures that have lava cling to them have -15 speed and take 3d6 (10) fire damage each round at the end of their turns until 1 minute passes, or they are cooled through other means, such as getting wet or taking cold damage.The AoE left behind is difficult terrain, and creatures that move through it have lava cling to them (reflex negates). You ignore all the negative effects of your roiling magma.]]></description><link>classes/bender/archetypes/firebender/firebending-style.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/bender/archetypes/firebender/firebending-style.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Your damage is fire.Increase speed by 10.Gain resistance to fire and frost damage.You can physically manipulate fire within 30 ft.

Must take at least 30 fire damage to unfreeze. You can unfreeze them as an instant action if they are within 30 ft.Choose a point on the surface of the water within 60 feet of you. Water within 30 ft rapidly starts to twist and turn toward that point, carrying anything within. Creatures within the area are immediately caught in the whirlpool (fort negates, putting them out of the AoE at nearest point). When the creature is caught, and every round thereafter, they take your blast damage (crush) and are pulled closer to the center in a very random fashion (roll dice to determine which side they end up on). After the second round of being caught, they are completely submerged underwater.Each round a creature can attempt an athletics check as a FRA to escape the whirlpool's area.
You are immune to the effects of your own whirlpool.
All creatures in the area are made wet.Special: If you use this outside of a body of water, its DC decreases by 2 and its radius decreases to 15 ft.Entomb a creature in ice (reflex reduces effect to frosty). An attack that does 10 crush damage or 5 fire damage destroys the ice and frees the creature. An entombed creature can roll an athletics check as a standard action to escape.By spending 1000g to perform a special ritual, requiring 10 minutes of concentration, you can bless a small vial of water with incredible healing capabilities. You can use this blessed water to bring a creature back from the dead at 1 hp if it died within the last minute. You can innately tell when a creature is too far gone to heal with this.
You can only have one vial of this blessed liquid at a time.As a standard action, enter octopus stance for 10 minutes, causing 8 tendrils of water to form around you. As an instant action, you can take a shield action or parry by sacrificing a tentacle.Cause an enormous and powerful wave of water to wash over the world. Form a wave 60 ft wide and 30 ft high that originates from your space and launch it in a direction. It moves 60 feet each round on your turn for 3 rounds before crashing. When the wave passes over a creature, it gets picked up by the wave (fort negates). When it gets picked up and every round after it takes blast damage and is entombed in the wave. A creature can attempt athletics with a -4 penalty as a FRA to escape, getting deposited somewhere near where they were trapped. If a creature is within the wave when it crashes, it takes 50% increased damage and is stunned for 1 round.You can choose to ride the wave if you wish. The wave deals massive damage to structures and carries objects unless they are securely rooted in the ground. All creatures in the area are made wet.Special: If the waves starting point is outside of a body of water, its DC decreases by 2, its height decreases to 15 and its width decreases to 30.Take control of the body of creature within 30 ft of you (assuming a significant portion of its body composition is made of water like humanoids), stunning it for 3 rounds (fort reduces to stagger for 3 rounds). As part of initially using the ability, and each round it is staggered/stunned by this ability as a swift action, you can cause the creature to attack its friends. If the creature is stunned, you can move it up to its speed and make simple attacks or take the charge action. If it is staggered, you can only force it to make a simple attack.]]></description><link>classes/bender/archetypes/waterbender/waterbending-style.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/bender/archetypes/waterbender/waterbending-style.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><link>classes/bender/archetypes/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/bender/archetypes/README.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[oddball-spells]]></title><description><![CDATA[Because the technique progression of the Bender class is awkward, I have gone out of my way to take the work out of finding what techniques work for your element outside of the technique trees I recommended.

You can still cast any of these spells without staff components.Just as a reminder, some of these techniques you won't have access to until certain levels, since firebenders and waterbenders don't unlock the variants to their blasts until levels 5 and 3 respectively.The techniques are listed in order of their level.

Allowing that kind of power while completely restrained can create problems.In general, I'd say that anything that can prevent you from making unarmed attacks can also prevent you from using elemental blast/wave/techniques. Some exceptions can be made (like firebending's melt feature), but in general, standard methods of restraint should be sufficient to prevent most abilities from functioning.In the show, elemental attacks can originate from places other than directly where the attacker is standing.I have simplified elemental blast to always be ranged from a range, and letting you choose to make it ranged or melee when creatures are within your natural reach.

When you succeed on a wild empathy check against a beast, you can communicate a complex set of instructions that are unusual, even uncomfortable, but not physically impossible for the creature. This can include things like a cat or dog walking on 2 legs for a short period, a rat making an unusually large amount of noise squeaking or a fish jumping out of water to do a barrel roll. This beast can also serve as an emissary to its kind in the surrounding area. If you are willing to wait 10 minutes (and the beast in question has a substantial local population), this singular beast can multiply into dozens, or potentially hundreds to perform incredibly unusual activities. A bunch of local cats marching in the streets to your marching orders, a band of differently sized rats squeaking a simple jingle you orchestrate or an entire school of fish moving to make shapes of your choosing as you speak (ex finding nemo).You can only call a group of beasts in this way 1/week.You can always find a general category of beast (something smart, a swimmer, something rideable, beast of burden, a reptile etc) by spending 5 minutes to look around your environment, provided there is one that exists.If you [mana burn], you can will a general category of beast to come to you immediately, even if it isn't native to this environment, so long as it wouldn't quickly die existing where you are.You can never call upon a specific type of creature when you use this feature. Generally speaking, weaker creatures and herbivores are the first to respond.You get advantage on wild empathy checks when used against beasts/magical beasts.As a swift action, you can copy any animal you can see within 30 ft. This transformation gives no boons, merely changes your size/appearance. You can speak normally while in animal form. This transformation lasts indefinitely, but can be ended as a swift action.While transformed you have advantage on disguise checks to go unnoticed if the animal could reasonably be there (dogs in urban areas, birds perched on trees, but not horses in an inn or a dinosaur in the arctic).You can call beasts and magical beasts to your side to aid you in battle.The type of help they provide is something they must be able to do naturally. The entire effect must happen within 60 ft of you and the AoE is a 20 ft radius or a 60 ft line. Each effect that deals damage always does (3d6+CL) damage.The effects are not limited to, but should be no more powerful than…This ability has a 1 minute cooldown.You gain the service of a specific animal to aid you on your journey. It grows more powerful as you do. More rules on beast companions in the beast companion section of beast trainer.Its level is 1/3 your level.1/day you can force a serendipity check, so long as the result includes animals as a major component. You must decide what you want to happen first, then your DM tells you its DC. Negotiate a simpler task if you think the DC is too high.Some examples of what you can accomplish…If you fail the check then nothing happens, potentially making you look like an idiot depending on the setup.Gain a new option with Nature StrikesYou summon a cat/kitten to a spot you can see within 100 ft. The cat immediately starts doing something silly or adorable, like eating a cheeseburger or existing with a silly outfit. Creatures within 30ft of this cat are fascinated for 1 minute (will negates). Creatures that are minions to you get no save.Creature doesn't need to be a cat. Can easily be some other silly animal. Cats just have a high concentration of silly.You get an honorary crown, befitting of a king of beasts.All beasts treat you with the reverence usually only afforded to royalty by their subjects and servants. Unless a beast is under direct control from another creature, or a higher level than you, it will not harm you or otherwise impair you. Nature Strike can be used every other round and commanding large groups of beasts using Band of Beasts can be performed every day.If you stay in the same roundabout area, such as a forest or a valley, all your beast subjects will come to you when your kingdom comes under siege. This could mean the destruction of habitat, hunting on a large scale or particularly ominous creatures moving in. They can give you detailed descriptions about unnatural phenomenon or strange creatures as well as their general location.]]></description><link>classes/druid/beast-whisperer.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/druid/beast-whisperer.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[hive]]></title><description><![CDATA[Your body has transformed to be a suitable home for a specific type of insect.

As a standard action, turn the entirety of your body/gear into a large swarm, gaining the following features.You can speak but you are unable to wield a staff in hive form, making you unable to cast spells.
You can revert back to your original form as a standard action.You can also choose to host groundborne insects, such as ants. You lose the fly speed and gain a land and climb speed of 40. Your swarm attack damage increases to 3d6.Any hive of insects under your control also protects your allies. While within the swarm, you allies are treated as though they have cover (+2 ac and reflex).When you attack with hive body, you can attack all creatures within your natural reach.

If it is ever defeated, it returns to you and this ability is disabled until you rest. While reunited with you, your swarm has regen 1.If you share a space with your swarm, you can choose to absorb it as an instant action.

You can also inflict this upon a creature you have skin to skin contact with as a standard action. This infection deals no damage and has no noticeable side effects or visual symptoms at all.While a creature is infected, you get a +2 bonus on skill checks made against it. You also know the direction they are from you. You can infect up to 5 people at once. Infecting more forces you to decide to free another. You can remove an infection as a free action.This infection can be identified and removed with a medicine check (DC=class DC).You don't just grow mushrooms, you become the mushroom. Every day you can grow 3 mushrooms on your body that contain magic within them that is unleashed when plucked and eaten. The magic is chosen when they are plucked. Plucking and eating/feeding is a single swift action. You can choose to grow new mushrooms with new powers on the following days, but growing new ones drains the magic from the old ones.
Mushrooms can be preemptively plucked and handed out to allies so they don’t need to be next to you to consume.In addition to spreading your infection, the mushrooms can have the following effects…By touching a surface, you can cause a tiny toadstool to sprout at that location. In less than ideal environments, they quickly perish. You can choose to leave behind a trail of these tiny toadstools behind when you while you walk.You can telepathically communicate to any creatures infected by your spores.1/minute when you fall below half hp, you release a cloud of toxic gas within a 10 ft radius. While within the gas, creatures not infected by your spores are sickened 1 and have blurred vision. These effects persist for 1 round after leaving the cloud.As a swift action, you can cause your creations to glow with bio luminescence. Any creatures you have infected with spores as well as any mushrooms you create with Power Up or Mush Touch glow with a bright light in a 5ft radius.This isn't particularly useful in bright places, but in darkness it can light the way.
Glowing creatures take a -5 penalty to stealth and cannot use darkness to hide.You can cause dead or decaying organic matter to be overtaken by fungus and accelerate the decomposition process. This can be used to target things like corpses, fallen trees and leaves, or even wooden doors. This typically has the effect of damaging the structural integrity of the object. For something like a small wooden barrier, it only takes a few rounds. For something much larger like a wall or an enormous fallen tree, it can take minutes.This provides sustenance to you, and this limits its usability. Decomposing something about your size like a door is more like a snack, but a particularly large object like an ornate wooden staircase is like eating a feast all on your own. You may need to wait until you are hungry again to fully decompose such objects.By spending 1 mana, you can animate a tiny mushroom to have little legs and eyes. They perish if attacked, have a speed of 30 and use your perception/stealth scores. You can give them telepathic orders, but they can do little more than keep watch or wander in general directions. They will mentally alert you (waking you up) if you they see something unusual, like an intruder, or something dangerous/scary. You can teach them a specific creature if you wanted them to find someone or something in specific.If they touch a creature, they can transfer your infection. This is usually only possible against incapacitated, friendly or willing creatures. Against an unwilling creature, you must succeed on a melee attack against a DD creature (uses your attack bonus).You can scry through the mushmen. You cannot recover the mana as long as the mushman persists, even if you rest. If the mushman returns to you safely, you recover the mana burn. If it dies, you must rest to restore it. You can willingly dismiss a muWhen you get the wet condition, you increase 1 size category instead. Further applications of wet apply normally. You shrink back to normal size after you rest or with exposure to direct sunlight for a few minutes.You can create an additional Power Up each day.

It flies at a speed of 30 at the end of each of your turns, moving in a direct line towards its target. This can lead to the mushroom getting "caught" on solid terrain.If it ever enters the space of the target creature, or if another enemy enters its space, it is immediately infected. The creature then takes d6/lvl poison damage (fort halves) and is dazed for 1 round.Make a mushroom that you can feed to a creature that has died in the last minute to restore them to 1 hp.

You can also use it to make attacks with +10 reach during your turn (deals crush damage).Whenever you land a tongue attack, or just lick someone, you learn a tidbit of information about the creature. This information is one of the few things: A random piece of personal information (such as a love interest), something that weighs heavy on the creature's mind (such as upcoming important events) or the creature itself (as per one section of monster lore). If you've already learned about the creature through monster lore (even from an ally or previously licking the creature) you can instead learn about another category.Your claws are considered to be of adamantine toughness. You get a +4 bonus to sunder attacks and athletics checks to break things.Whenever you take the charge action, you automatically destroy obstacles, cover and difficult terrain that is of solid or lesser toughness. Anything harder you get a free attempt to break it. You can charge directly into the air and are immune to fall damage any round you charge. You have resistance to all damage when you charge.You gain the swallow monster quality. Deals 3d8 (13) poison damage.
You get DRA 3 vs swallowed creatures. You can also swallow creatures you successfully drag with your grasping tongue special attack.Once per minute you can inhale with such sudden force as to evacuate the air in its proximity, causing a sudden wave of air pressure from the implosion. All creatures and loose objects within 30 feet of the you take (2d6+d6/odd lvl) sonic damage and are pulled adjacent to you (fort halves damage and negates pull).
Swallowed creatures are also affected and automatically fail their save.You become a pure destructive force of the universe to such a degree that you can manifest the Endless Abyss. This takes the form of a black hole that is integrated into your body somehow (replaces eye, in the back of the throat, or something more exotic like the dark star skins in league) and is immediately recognized as dangerous by most.You can choose to annihilate objects that you comes into contact with, absorbing them into the abyss, as long as you are larger than them. You can concentrate for 1 minute to allow the Abyss to consume a defeated creature within reach. Add 1 to your soul counter. For every soul consumed, you can regurgitate an annihilated object or creature. Regurgitated creatures and objects are in the same state they were in when they were annihilated.Whenever a creature within reach is defeated, you consume a piece of its soul and recover 10 hp. If they are within 60 ft of you, you can teleport adjacent to them as an immediate action to get a nibble of that soul.
You can only munch a specific creature's soul 1/day.]]></description><link>classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/destroyer.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/destroyer.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><link>classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/README.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[succ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Succ shifters are the schemers of the fiend shifters.

They take their favorite parts of other creatures and add it to themselves.Your specialization is martial. Your technique trees are barbarism and beastmode.When you break the first seal, 4 spiked chains burst from your back that you can make attacks with (deals crush damage). They function as additional opposable limbs that can be used to hold objects, climb walls, grapple creatures etc. The chains have an additional 5 feet of reach during your turn.When you break the second seal, your chains now have an additional 10 ft of reach during your turn. You can innately cast <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/necromancy/level-5/shackles-of-pain" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/necromancy/level-5/shackles-of-pain" target="_self">shackles of pain</a> as a swift action, taking up one of your shackles while the effect persists. Instead of its usual range, it has a range of reach. It also has an altered effect. It does not reduce any of the damage you take, but instead causes chained creatures to take half the damage you take as true damage.When you break the final seal, your chains now have an additional 15 ft of reach during your turn. Your share my pain feature can target up to 4 creatures within reach at once.Numbers indicate level requirements (9 total)By spending 1 mana when you land an attack against a creature with your chains or claws, you can shackle them. One of your chains pops out of your body and stays put at the point they were at when you attacked them. At the end of their next turn, they are pulled back to that position and your chain returns to you. The chain immediately breaks if the creature gets more than 60 feet away, or if someone uses athletics to break it as a standard action.In any case, escaped chains reappear attached to you.After a battle, you can peruse the bodies of your defeated foes for pieces of them you like, such as their eyes, teeth, feathers, scales etc. You can surgically remove them with your claws and add them to yourself after 1 minute, either replacing that part of your body or you somehow make room. Increase your max hp by 1 each piece.
The parts need to be fresh, so waiting for more than 5 minutes ruins their potency. Unchained shifters are a bit picky and will only add pieces of creatures of their level or higher (though they won't retroactively remove pieces as they level up). You can have a maximum of (3+3*lvl) pieces.Gain combat reflexes as a bonus feat.
Whenever you provoke an AoO, the attacking creature provokes an AoO from you. The act of provoking isn't enough and the creature can simply opt to not attack you to deprive you of your AoO.Whenever you take damage, keep a running tally of how much damage you have taken. After 1 minute of not taking damage, restore half of this value as hp. Any [healing] effect that does not grant temp hp subtracts twice the healing amount from this value.You can attack yourself, dealing damage as normal, requiring no attack roll. You gain +2 attack and +10 speed for 1 minute after doing so. If an ally attacks you, or includes you in the AoE of an effect that deals damage, you also get this bonus. Any damage you take during your turn has 100% effectiveness against creatures shackled by share my pain.While at or below 50% hp, you have +2 AC, +2 to all DCs you inflict and +2 to all saves.On-hit your attacks apply a stacking debuff (similar to shaken/sickened) called pain. Pain gives a creature weakness 1 to all damage types. Any [healing] effect removes all pain stacks.You can use your share my pain feature on allies. Instead of its usual effect, it causes them to take half damage, redirecting the mitigated damage back to you.Whenever an enemy within 60 ft of you fails a skill check, fails to even graze with an attack or fails a saving throw, you restore 5 hp. This healing does not interfere with flesh wound's healing.]]></description><link>classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/unchained.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/unchained.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[youkai]]></title><description><![CDATA[Youkai shifters have a powerful being sealed inside of them. As their relationship deepens, so too does their power. Youkai abilities are inspired by Japanese folklore. Your starting spell list is Moogan and ???When you break the first seal, you gain FH 1 while below half hp. When you roll a natural 1, your youkai spirit intervenes, allowing you to reroll it as an immediate action. You can break the first (second and final) seal as an immediate action to activate this reroll ability.When you break the second seal, your FH increases to 2 while below half hp, and you gain FH 1 when at or above half hp. Even when you are deprived actions (such as being staggered, dazed or defeated), your youkai spirit can take any of the actions listed in the below abilities.
Spirit Siege, Spirit Guide, Spirit GuardianWhen you break the final seal, your FH turns into regeneration, stopped by poison or fire damage. Through you and your youkai spirit acting in tandem, you gain an additional swift action each turn.Numbers indicate level requirements (6 total)As long as you are missing hp or are bleeding, you can use this ability.
1/rnd you can make a claw attack as though it was a thrown weapon (20/40 range) by digging your claws into your wound and throwing blades of blood at an enemy.Your youkai spirit is always watching over you, even when you do not manifest it. You get a +4 bonus to initiative and perception. You do not take a penalty to perception while sleeping.In combat your spirit actively participates to defend you. You cannot be flanked. Your spirit can possess your body and move with a 30 ft hover speed and automatically spend your standard action to disengage, even if you lack those actions from being stunned for example. When you are defeated, creatures must still beat your AC or poise break you to attack/move you and you can still make reflex saves.When you grapple a creature, your spirit also grabs a piece of their soul, making them fatigued. If you are not poise broken by the start of your next turn, your spirit devours this piece of soul. The creature you grappled becomes drained 1 and you regain (the creature's lvl) HP. A creature can only be affected by spirit snatcher 1/day.
The creature remains fatigued for as long as they have the drained condition.You grow a third eye, giving you the ability to innately cast glimpse of truth 1/day.
As a swift action, you can fire a laser beam from this eye. Roll a d4 to see what you get, then choose a target. Make an attack roll as though using a thrown weapon (20, 40). It deals 3d6 (10) damage with a random type and bonus effect. You can decide which eye beam you would like to use, but doing so closes your third eye, disabling this ability for 1 minute. You cannot use this ability while blinded or while you have blurred vision.Your youkai spirit plays a much more active role in combat. It is capable of dashing around the battlefield before quickly returning to defend you once again. As a swift action, limited to once each round, you can command your spirit to do one of the following actions. Its attacks don’t suffer your MA penalty.]]></description><link>classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/youkai.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/fiend-shifter/archetypes/youkai.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Fiend Shifter is someone who has stolen the secrets to the powers of fiends, slowly letting this power overtake them.

Creature's find it difficult to harm you. Creatures who attempt to harm you must redirect their aggression for the remainder of their turn (will negates).

You still cannot add luck twice (ie you both add luck to the roll).When you use Channel Energy, enemies in range that were aggressors/not acting in self-defense are pacified for 5 rounds (will negates). They get a new save at the end of their turns if you or your allies take aggressive actions versus their allies, and it ends immediately if you or your allies take aggressive actions towards them.If there are no enemies left, initiative ends, and this ability can be extended for up to 10 minutes as long as you try resolving the conflict peacefully.When you use healing touch, creatures get a new save against any lingering effects that would normally give additional saves (such as poison and some fear effects). Does not apply to permanent status like curses or drain.Creatures that touch your aura of mercy receive a blessing for 1 hour. This blessing allows them to exist inside of otherwise hazardous environments without harm. Blessed creatures ignore environmental effects like toxic volcanic gas, thin air at extreme heights, extremes in temperature, the vacuum of space or the pressure/lack of air in underwater environments.This does not make you immune to hazardous weather, such as hail, windstorms, lightning, quicksand etc. Only passive effects that prevent you from existing.When you rest in a settlement of at least 100 people, you can mark one of the doorways, portals, or similar entrance in the place you rested as your Mystic Doorstep.Until you rest again, as long as you are within 10 miles of the place you slept, you can conjure a Mystic Door that links to the Mystic Doorstep for one minute.

Once the Mystic Door disappears, so does your Mystic Doorstep.This effect does not require line of sight.As a standard action, touch a creature. On an ally, one harmful spell or supernatural effect immediately ends, unless it is permanent. On an enemy, this functions as Dispel Magic. For cursed items, this allows the safe removal of the item, but requires a caster level check.This has a 10 minute unique cooldown.You recover from all stacks of drain every time you rest, regardless of conditions.As a standard action, you can touch a creature to absorb 1 stack of drain from them and you become drained 1.

Allies in your aura also gain this.You can change what you're resistant to by spending 10 minutes adjusting your magic.Your Holy Arrow has its range increased by 10.Creatures you heal with channel energy benefit from dispel (ignoring the cooldown), and can make a simple attack as an instant action.]]></description><link>classes/healer/explorer.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/healer/explorer.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Healers are magicians that combine natural talent, a breadth of experience, and a compassion for life that results in abilities that lift spirits and mend wounds, both literally and metaphorically.

Creatures within take your arm damage, are infected and are knocked back to the end of the cone (reflex negates).Ex. At this level it is a 15 ft cone. @12 it is a 35 ft cone.Whenever you shove a creature, it is pushed to the edge of your reach in a straight line, then an additional 10 ft. Creatures impacting terrain are staggered for 1 round (fort negates).Spend 3 mana to dig your enhanced arm into the ground and have it emerge in a space within reach. A 10 ft radius around this point is consumed by your organic growth, turning it into difficult terrain, even to hovering creatures. Enemies that start their turn within this area or move into it take your enhanced arm damage.Enemies within the area are siphoned until they leave.You can choose to maintain this ability indefinitely at no additional cost. If you are moved from your position or poise broken, this effect ends.This effect must be used through a solid surface. You need line of sight, but do not need line of effect.Whenever you shove a creature, all creatures in a line behind them are shoved as well (reflex negates).Enemies are infected until the effect is removed manually.
Rapid growth doesn't end infections.]]></description><link>classes/healer/symbiote.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/healer/symbiote.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[heros-quest]]></title><description><![CDATA[The quests for heroes are not always set in stone, you can feel free to come up with new ones, but these are things that exist inside of Oldschool Runescape (the game this class is based off of).

These jesters use their voice and appearance to cause confusion in all but the most perceptive bunch. Throw your voice and rapidly change who you are on a dime to make people think they are interacting with many people. Actors can pull all kinds of ridiculous stunts to get them into and out of trouble.Your proficiency in disguise is unmatched. You make a disguise as a swift action. Not only that, but you can be two people at once! This typically only functions with a singular person. You can change appearances and positions such that as long as both of your disguised personas are not visible at once, you can effectively inhabit both of them. In such scenarios you typically cause people to keep turning around to face whoever is speaking. You are constantly under the effects of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-1/ventriloquism" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-1/ventriloquism" target="_self">ventriloquism</a>. It does not have the buff tag. You can have your voice originate from a place you cannot see, such as around a corner or as a muffled voice inside of a chest.With proper venues, you can use disguise to make money as thought using a profession.Gain one each even level. Numbers next to the name are level requirements.You can roll deception as an immediate action when you fall below (10+2*lvl) hp to pretend as though you have lost the will to fight. The inflicting creature or their leader within 30 ft roll opposed insight. If you succeed, they ignore you until rejoin the fight. When you do, the first creature you attack is DD.You can exaggerate how painful something was, or make it seem as though something did not hurt at all. Roll deception or disguise (opposed by perception, insight or medicine) and you can play off a deadly wound as though it was nothing, even if it defeated you. In such a case you are still unable to perform actions, but your speed while defeated is not reduced.You can also do this when you take a relatively insignificant amount of damage to try and garner sympathy, or to convince a third party the attacker was trying to kill you etc.<br>You can use disguise to appear as a statue. While a statue, you cannot move or perform any actions, and otherwise functions as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/monster-qualities/other-traitss" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/monster-qualities/other-traitss" target="_self">hide in plain sight</a>.You can stir up a commotion to gather attention, only to hit your audience with some of the most mind-numbingly boring or awful performances they have every seen. When you begin your performance, decide whether you want to make it boring or cringe to decide its effects. Boring performances put audiences to sleep and cringe ones make them run to the hills (will negates).The creature with the highest will save is the one to roll a collective save for the audience. They are the brave audience member willing to break the audience's silence and boo you off the stage, snapping the rest of the audience out of it.You can harm or inconvenience someone without consequence. By first feigning assistance with a particular task, you can use it as an excuse to destroy items, spill beverages and overall show off how incompetent you can be. Creatures roll insight/perception (or perhaps even profession!) opposed to your disguise or deception. If you succeed, they are upset, but there are no immediate repercussions and you are just a waiter who fades into the background. Failure indicates a more intimate grilling and consequences appropriate for your misdeeds.You can attempt to do this repeatedly to the same person, but you have disadvantage on your skill checks.You can make the description of an item so tantalizing, so incredible that they must have it. During conversation, you can gloss up a particular item. You don't even need to possess the item, but it does need to exist. You can roll deception to exaggerate its quality, value or even function. If the creature fails its insight check, it immediately runs off to go find this item, or tries to get it from you.With this feature, you can essentially use deception as a profession skill to generate money. However you will damage your reputation by doing so.]]></description><link>classes/jester/actor.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/jester/actor.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[mime]]></title><description><![CDATA[You have to feel it to believe it. Mimes are exceptionally good at making the precise hand and body movements to convince others that what their gestures imply exist really do. So much so that they won't believe it when they actually do!You can create objects out of thin air. Said objects must relatively simple and fit within a 10x10x10 ft cube. You can mime a flat wall, but you can't make a rat maze. You can mime a long rope, but you cannot mime a pulley system. Miming requires a standard action.Outside of these limitations, you can do anything. Let your imagination run wild as you mime staircases, simple tools and all kinds of other things into existence at your convenience, and your enemies' inconvenience.A mime has a few routines that require significantly less strain in order to manifest. These specific uses of pantomime do not have the [mana burn] tag, but are more limited in scope. Each use costs 1 mana. You gain the "build a wall" practiced routine and another of your choosing at level 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.Build A Wall - You cause a flat 10x10 invisible wall to appear perpendicular to the direction you gesture. A creature cannot pass through it without a successful will save. Once a creature succeeds, all others make the save with advantage. If the initial creature fails, all others have disadvantage until one passes.Omnitool - You can pantomime a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/mundane-items/tools" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/mundane-items/tools" target="_self">mundane tool</a>, such as a fishing rod, a pick axe or a hammer. It only functions while in your hands, but otherwise functions as expected.
Lasso - You can pantomime rope, tying it around objects and using it as a lasso to hook around distant objects. There is no limit to how long you can make it, but it must be one continuous string. Other creatures can use the rope if they see you pantomiming it.
Binoculars - You put your hands over your eyes to enhance your vision. You can see distances hundreds of feet away with much greater detail.
Finger Gun - You can point at someone with your thumb in the air and move your thumb down to touch your index finger to "fire" at them. The creature takes 2d8+CL (9+CL) psychic damage (will halves). You can "upcast" this ability as though it were a spell, adding an additional d8 (4) of damage per additional mana spent.You can cast spells without verbal components.You can use your pantomiming skills to cause creatures to say things they might not normally say out loud. In neutral and friendly scenarios, you can start a game of charades. Choose one creature in particular to be your victim, then create an elaborate pantomime that causes them to say something in specific (will negates). This could be something silly like "Colonel Mustard in the library with a candle stick" or something more nefarious like "those disgusting green immigrants." Pass or fail, when you initiate this goading charade, the game ends as a result of awkwardness or everybody else getting discouraged at your weird pantomime. The response is generally limited to a short sentence.Creatures subject to this ability cannot be subject to it again until you rest. <br>You gain <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-2/silence" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-2/silence" target="_self">silence</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/arc/level-1/silencing-strike" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/arc/level-1/silencing-strike" target="_self">silencing strike</a> as innate techniques.

They are capable of doing things people typically might expect from cartoons. Taking your eyes off of them for just a second is a sure fire way to let them get away. They use incredible feats of acrobatics and sleight of hand in order to troll their enemies As a swift action, you can perform a prank. What this entails varies based on what kind of prank you choose. Slipping and Sliding - Pull out your banana peels and oil slicks. Toss one into a creatures space or into an empty space. It persists until cleaned up. The creature you tossed the prank at, and any creatures that later move into this space are knocked down (reflex negates).
Realistic Replicas - As long as nobody has direct line of sight of you, you can manufacture a dangerous and silly prank. You cover up a door, you hide a switch or you paint a cave into a wall with exceptional speed. A creature must roll perception against your sleight of hand or they don't realize the deception. They are immediately subject to a dirty trick, as though you had poise broken them, and they take 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) damage of an appropriate type.
Lemon Chaser - Throw some fuel on the fire to bring the pain. In this case, the fuel is citrus juice and the fire is an opponent within reach. If the creature is not damaged, this does nothing. If the creature is missing, hp, the creature becomes sickened 1 from the intense pain (fort negates). If they are bleeding, they instead become sickened 2 (fort halves).
Flower Power [recharge] - You activate a pocket ornament, allowing you to spray an unsuspecting foe. You make a creature within reach wet. Usable 1/combat.While you are trapped inside of a room, or a cage, cell etc, you automatically escape the moment someone doesn't keep an eye on your for at least one full round (or 6 seconds). You can never tell people how because a magician never reveals his secrets.Instead of disguise and deception, you gain proficiency and a +4 bonus with acrobatics and sleight of hand.Gain one each even level. Numbers next to the name are level requirements.As long as your hands are open and you do not wear a shield, you can effectively wield 3 different items at a time, provided each one could normally be used with one hand. You can add an additional item to the mix every even level. You can also choose include random objects on your person, or that you pick up. Creatures cannot take these items from you unless they successfully disarm you.If you are ever stunned or dazed, you stop juggling, and you can choose what items you still hold in hand.As a swift action, you can roll acrobatics to jump directly onto a creature, balancing on their shoulders, back etc (reflex negates).When you jump on and at the start of your turn while you are balancing on a creature, they are made clumsy 1. You can be removed by poise breaking, or anything that forcefully moves you from your position. Any AoE effect that targets you also targets the creature you balance on.Given 3 rounds of setup, you can plan an elaborate ruse. Using mirrors, conveniently camouflaged hidey holes and hidden compartments in boxes, you can appear to make creatures completely disappear. The creature with the highest perception bonus in a group of onlookers rolls perception opposed by your sleight of hand. If you succeed, then the creature you choose can slip away undetected for the next minute. After the minute is up, people catch on, realize it isn't a joke etc and start the search...If they care.Whenever you take damage, you have a 33% chance to disappear from sight in a cloud of smoke, deflating or something equally unusual, rendering you <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-6/invisibility" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-6/invisibility" target="_self">invisible</a> until the start of your next turn.I recommend making effects like this a high roll. AKA a 5 or 6 on a d6.Take a deep breath, stick your thumb in your mouth and blow on it as a swift action. Doing so causes your body to expand in delightfully silly ways.
Belly - Inflate yourself. Just like a balloon. This gives you a 10 ft fly speed as long as you hold your breath and perform no actions other than movement.
Brain - Big brain time. You gain a +2 bonus to the next intelligence based check you make this round.
Hand - Increase the size of your hand. Your next unarmed strike this turn adds (d6/odd level) damage.
Assets - Attempt to charm a creature (will negates). They have a +4 bonus on the save if they wouldn't normally be attracted to you due to sexual orientation (or lack thereof for something like a robot). In combat the charmed creature gets a new save every turn. Out of combat the charm lasts 10 minutes, and once it wears off, the creature cannot be charmed again until rest.You gain a special attack.Flatten - Smush a creature against the ground with such force that they are practically rendered two-dimensional. The creature has their speed reduced by 15 and their reach reduced to 5 ft. This lasts until an ally uses the aid action on them, or the creature spends a standard action.
The damage of this attack is changed to bludgeoning. It deals your level in additional damage.You can use this special attack on your allies or yourself in order to slip underneath things like doors. You can much more easily hide underneath furniture etc. Allies take no damage from this attack and can exit their smushed state as a swift action.]]></description><link>classes/jester/prankster.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/jester/prankster.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Jesters are masters of misdirection. Their methodology varies, but the goal is always the same: Confound and deceive. Some choose to do so with prestidigitation, drawing the eyes of creatures where they want, and more importantly, away from where they don't. Others use their voices and costumes to have a 3 way conversation with only themselves and their poor victim. One should always keep their eyes on a jester and their goals, for the moment they don't, they might just disappear.{% tabs %}

If you can personalize the insult to an extent the GM determines it digs deep, the DC is 2 higher.
Disarm - Roll a disarm attack. In additional to its usual effects, roll base weapon damage, unless a technique already does so.
Trick - Roll a dirty trick attack. In additional to its usual effects, roll base weapon damage, unless a technique already does so.Roast your enemies, causing them to falter when it matters most. As an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 ft to subtract a d6 to a d20 roll (minus luck checks). At level 6 this increases to d8. At level 10 this improves to d10.This ability can be used once per minute. You can ignore the recharge time and use it again if you [mana burn] 2.Add 1+½ lvl to all skills that you lack proficiency in. You can make checks for all skills as though you were proficient.
You also have the unique ability to perform any skill in unconventional (and sometimes nonsensical) ways. This could mean using strange tools, using your feet instead of your hands and adding superfluous steps for added flare.After a minute of scheming with an item in direct contact with you, you can make sure that this item is always there when you need it. This item must be something you can carry and must fit within a 5x5x5ft cube. You can only have one hidden prop at the ready at a time. You procure these items by pulling them out of hidden hatches, around corners or from behind someones ear. If it is a handheld object (like a trumpet or a sword), this requires no action. Anything larger requires a swift action.These items effectively do not exist as long as you have them as hidden props. They cannot be stolen from you and they do not exist in a specific place. They exist wherever it is most convenient for the jester at any given moment, making other creatures unable to interact with them if you believe it inconvenient.If you are killed, the items fall out of your pocket. Nonlethal methods of retrieving these items against the jester's will require charms, curses and the like.There is a secret network of jesters, their assistants and their fans that all work to aid each other. As long as you are in a situation where there are others present but not currently in sight (such as a person in a nearby shop, or guards in the adjacent room), you can give a signal to have them act. Depending on the type of signal, you can have them act differently.Cause a Commotion - The plant will cause a ruckus by shouting, playing music and being obnoxious. At the very least, it will momentarily draw the attention of creatures so you can hide (or something similar).
Vouch For Me - A random member of the crowd cheers for you, or a prison guard tells their coworker to lay off you a bit. This isn't enough to get you out of situations, but will likely give people pause before inflicting any form of harsh judgement.
Oops? - The plant will "accidentally" do something, like opening a window in the way of someone chasing you, or unlocking a door for you to let you inside.In order to recharge this ability, you have to return the favor in some way to the person that assisted you after the situation resolves itself. Usually if you remain in the area, they will come to find you.Spend 1 minute familiarizing yourself with an area. You can interact with an environment, including moving things, painting things, destroying things etc. Then as a standard action while nobody is looking, you can cause it to revert back to its original state, sans minor details like you stealing items from a safe, or adding a few innocuous items. You can do this even if you are not present. You can intuitively tell when nobody is looking and you can use this ability.]]></description><link>classes/jester/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/jester/README.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=".html" length="0" type="text/html"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=".html"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Trust in the power of Frogg-Saran.

If you use anything to reroll a natural one, or have advantage and don't roll multiple 1s, you do not gain a luck dice. You can have an unlimited number of luck dice. With many saved up you hum/glow with power. At the start of each day if you have zero luck dice, gain one.Whenever you cast a (non cantrip) spell, roll a DC 5 luck check. If you fail, roll on the wild magic table for a bonus effect. Every time you pass this luck check, increase the DC by 2. When wild magic triggers, reset the DC back to 5. Triggering wild magic is the only way to reduce the DC of this luck check.The effect always triggers after the casting of the spell has been resolved.Roll a d8+1. This number permanently becomes your lucky number. Whenever you roll this number on a d20, you gain a luck dice and you treat the result as 10 higher.Every even level you can replace one of your spells known with another spell.

Usable 1/minute without spending a luck dice.You say a lot of weird things, but sometimes trapped in the madness is a grain of truth. Once per game session, you can will practically anything to be true, though how true it is varies. First you make your intention to the DM to be known."I'm good friends with the royalty in this town.""There is a secret entrance into the base through this cave.""There's someone on the other side of this door" right before you blow it up.How true it becomes depends on what the bronze senses are tingling over. Being friends with royalty is unlikely, so its much more likely you're friends with the banished prince. There may just be a secret entrance through the cave, but the tunnel has since collapsed, only allowing the smallest of creatures inside. Someone being directly on the other side of a door is context based, but in the right scenario could possibly catch your enemies off guard. ]]></description><link>classes/lunatic/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/lunatic/README.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=".html" length="0" type="text/html"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=".html"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[wild-magic]]></title><description><![CDATA[When you trigger wild magic, first roll a d4 to determine which chart you roll on. 1 is red, 2 is yellow, 3 is purple and 4 is green.After that, roll d20s until you get a result on the chart.

They come in 2 main variants: pilots and suitors. Pilots are your typical mecha-style characters that hop into a larger robot and steer it around. Suitors have something more form fitting that augments their movement and fighting.{% tabs %}

Requires Archetype{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.
These technique points can be used on the marksman and tree.Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips.Mechanics start off with a specific type of mech, determined by archetype. The variety tends to come from how integrated it is into the mechanics themselves, such as a vehicle they pilot or a suit that augments themselves.This mech can be sundered, lowering the DC of class abilities that are dependent on it by 2.
When you are defeated, this mech becomes unusable and requires repairing. This requires a (30-engineering roll) minutes (minimum 1) and appropriate tools. If you ever lose this mech, you can recreate it in (30-engineering roll) days (minimum 1) and 200g of materials like metals and comfy leather seats.Unless otherwise noted, all class features only function while mounted on mech.Mechs have many powerful abilities that require the mechanic to gather power. This always has some kind of distinct audio and visual quality, such as revving engines, glowing chassis, steam erupting from every nook and cranny etc. You automatically fail stealth checks when charging, and creatures get a +20 bonus to perception to notice you when charging. Rolling initiative resets your charge, requiring you to charge again.{% hint style="danger" %}
This mechanic (teehee) is designed to make it so you cannot use charge attacks on turn 1 of combat. Period. You can't use it as a surprise attack, preemptively charge and then enter combat etc. Hopefully this is airtight, but just in case, don't let players do this.
{% endhint %}Charging is a free action, but you cannot use a charge move in the same turn that you charge. Vise versa is also true; you cannot charge right after using a charge move. This usually makes every odd turn a charge turn, and every even turn a charge attack turn, provided you have the actions and don't spend them doing other things.{% hint style="info" %}
The terminology is a bit weird but there is a distinction between the class feature Charge and the general tag [recharge]. These 2 things do not interact. The mechanic has many of both types of abilities and neither interact with each others cool downs.
{% endhint %}You get engineering as a bonus skill and a +4 bonus to it. Doesn't require mech.Gain 2 augments, one of which uses the charge feature. Augments are customizable features that can give you new abilities, add additional limbs and enhance your physical abilities.Gain an additional augment each even level.Gain point blank master.As a standard action, closely examine an object or creature within 30 ft to get a +4 bonus on knowledge checks related to it. You can choose to also lock onto them (if you're level 2).You can choose a foe within 60 ft of as a swift action to hone in on a foe. Your attacks have seeking and you get a +2 bonus on attack rolls against this foe until you dismisses this ability (free action). You automatically know the position of the creature. You can automatically lock on to a creature you scan, regardless if you succeed on the knowledge check. This ability does not negate cover for the purposes of attacking this foe, but you are still aware of the foe's position until it moves at least 300 ft away from you.You can lock on to only one creature at a time.]]></description><link>classes/mechanic/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/mechanic/README.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[suitor]]></title><description><![CDATA[Suitors wear their mech like it was a fancy suit of armor.Your mech is essentially a piece of full body armor shaped like you that you must enter to operate. It is form fitting and is operated by you physically moving your limbs. Once you put it on, you can activate it and deactivate it as an instant action 1/turn, causing it to either disappear or reappear. While it is deactivated, it leaves behind large, distinct tattoos that look like wires, power sources or something similar behind.Usually because of this feature, there isn't much reason to get out of the mech outside of repairs.
In order for another creature to use your mech, they must roll a DC (20+your engineering bonus) to use it. Otherwise it is a very fancy hunk of metal to them.Because your mech is a suit of armor, you can decide what type of armor it mimics (light, medium, heavy), provided you have the required strength.Many offensive suit augments require hands to utilize. Unlike a pilot who can get a more complex control scheme to activate additional limbs, you cannot use extra limbs to control the additional augments. If you take more than 2 hand augments, then you need to swap between them as a standard action. You can also remove hand augments as a standard action to allow fine hand manipulation. Hands consumed by augments can be used to hold/grab things, but cannot wield weapons/shields or perform fine manipulation Ex. You can drag an ally to safety but you can't feed them a potion. You can open a door, but you cant lockpick it.Gain a hand augment.]]></description><link>classes/mechanic/suitor.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/mechanic/suitor.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[puppetmaster]]></title><description><![CDATA[This archetype replaces psychic implantsYou can take control of the body of a creature that gets defeated within 30 ft of you as an instant action if they are the target of your hypnotic stare, or you can redirect your stare as an immediate action if they aren't (will negates).

All of these effects have the [contingent], [subtle] and [companion] tags. They are all (Su) abilities. Unlike other contingent effect, there is no visual indicator.When you inflict the implant, you give the creature a simple suggestion and a trigger. Something is simple when it requires little effort, isn't dangerous and only requires a few minutes. This won't make a creature act against its ethos, but can make them do something unusual for them. "Don't lock the door on your way out. Vouge for me when I speak to the elder." Etc You can also leave the implant's suggestion blank, and make a suggestion later by verbally making it.When you activate the implant, you cause the creature to not notice you and your allies while you exist nearby for 10 minutes. The creature treats your actions as normal as long as they are not violent and does not remember what you and your allies did during this time.When you activate the implant, you can sense through the creature for up to 10 minutes. You see through its eyes, hear with its ears etc using all of its senses from their PoV. You are effectively stunned while you do this and can choose to redirect your senses back to your own body if you take damage or are otherwise harmed.When you activate the implant, the implanted creature gains 5+(your level*3) temp hp. This forces them to push past their bodies usual limits, so it also inflicts drained 1.What you activate this implant, the creature suddenly finds themselves in a cloud of darkness that they cannot escape.

They stay the same size, but you can make them appear more fiendish, undead, they grow a bunch of tentacles, etc. Their exact appearance is up to you. The transformation lasts 1 minute.Reactions may vary from directly attacking the creature to causing a scene. No matter what though, the creature is automatically shaken 2 during the transformation.When you activate this implant, you can have the creature appear to die to all others. The creature actually turns invisible, as per the spell. Creatures get a will save to disbelieve the illusory corpse when they interact with it.]]></description><link>classes/mesmerist/psychic-implants.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/mesmerist/psychic-implants.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mesmerists always have eye-catching irises, tattoos, masks or baubles to place more emphasis on their eyes.

Answers are usually brief or cryptic. The corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. The corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.Touch a dead creature to perceive what happened during the last minute it was alive and conscious.Alternatively project your senses through one of the undead you control for 10 up to minutes. You can continue to give your minions orders while you observe. You sense using all of your faculties from the minions position. You can speak using your voice or a raspier one more appropriate for an undead creature. You are stunned while you use this feature. You can end it as an instant action, and it ends automatically if you take damage.You can initiate contact with spirits of the dead that reside in the Underworld. To do so you need a few things...
An artifact of significance to the creature, such as a weapon, trinket or family picture.
The creature's full name
1 minute of uninterrupted concentration
If you meet the conditions, and the creature's spirit is not trapped in some way (including inside of a living body) then the spirit temporarily inhabits your body, up to 10 minutes. If the ritual fails, you know why, such as the artifact not being of enough significance, the creature being alive etc.You lose access to your body, only viewing the events as though a passenger in your own body, therefore requiring a 3rd party to do the interacting with the spirit. The creature speaks in its own voice, but otherwise moves and interacts with the physical world via your body. Whether or not a spirit is interested in speaking changes drastically from person to person. Some spirits will be happy to be able to speak with loved ones, and others will immediately leave at the sight of a past enemy. A persuasion check is usually in order before the spirit leaves.The spirit is mostly limited to only what they knew in life, and they are still able to fully articulate their thoughts as though they were of sound mind. Little information about the Mortal Realm passes into the Underworld, and less still reaches the ears of the average spirit.As an immediate action when a creature dies within 60 ft of you, you can choose to seal the creatures soul inside of a staff you wield. A tiny spectral cage forms at its tip with a miniature version of the creatures spirit inside. Until the staff is sundered, the cage is opened with sleight of hand, or you cage a new soul, the spirit is trapped inside of your staff.While trapped the spirit remains conscious and can perceive the world around it as it did in life. You can converse with the spirit, and you can silence it if it gets to loud.When you animate dead, you can choose to set its level to 3 and have it not consume a companion slot. You are allowed to give it a singular order at the time of creation that it fulfills until it is destroyed.]]></description><link>classes/necromancer/medium.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/necromancer/medium.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=".html" length="0" type="text/html"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=".html"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[A necromancer's primary power is the ability to give new life to corpses, adding them to their squad of undead minions.

Your apparent age cannot be magically altered, even through [polymorph] effects.Drawback - Whenever you try to appeal to authority to someone unfamiliar with your curse, you take a -2 penalty to any skill checks related. You take a -2 penalty to poise.EmpatheticYou love people. Those afflicted with the empathetic curse consider most people their friends, and find it difficult to treat others harshly, even those on the other side of the battlefield. Woe to he who makes an enemy of an empathetic oracle.Benefit - When you cast a spell or use an ability to restore hitpoints, it heals an additional 3 HP. Whenever you defeat a creature, they instead gain the time out condition. You can cause a creature that is defeated to automatically stabilize and not die as an immediate action.Drawback - You are physically unable to intentionally and knowingly kill living creatures, even when magically compelled to do so. If a creature within 30 feet of you is dying/bleeding out, you must at the very least stabilize them to prevent them from dying, using any actions you have available.Special - In scenarios where compulsively healing people equates to suicide (such as in a warzone) you can ignore the compulsion to save lives.FollowerYou live for someone else. Those afflicted with the follower curse have separation anxiety turned up to 11. Whoever they are bound to is burdened with the undying loyalty of their companion.Benefit - Choose another creature to form a permanent bond with. You can move in tandem with them if you have the movement. You can choose to be the target of a harmful effect targeting your bond as an instant action. If the effect is AoE and would target both of you, you can instead choose to automatically have them pass while you automatically fail. You get a +10 bonus to any skill checks related to your bond (heal checks to stabilize, perception to tell if someone is disguised as them etc). You can innately cast reincarnate (Frogg 2), but only targeting your bond. It also function on them if they are dead.Drawback - If you have not seen your bond for 1 minute, you are shaken 1. If you have not seen your bond for 1 hour, you are shaken 3. If you have not seen your bond for 1 day, you receive the prior penalties and cannot do anything other than search for them unless physically prevented from doing so. In the event you are shown convincing evidence that your bond is dead, you attempt to use resurrection magic to get them back. If that is impossible, you are shaken 3 for one week before you must select a new curse, or a new bond.FreneticCan you quit moving? Those afflicted with the frenetic curse are excellent multitaskers. They’re always pacing around and touching things when they do anything.Benefit - You get +2 init and a +4 bonus to AC when provoking attacks of opportunity. Increase your base speed by 10.Drawback - You must move at least 10 feet every round. You cannot take 20. If you cannot move, you take 3 true damage at the end of your turn.GenerousYou love to give to others. Those afflicted with the generous curse always tip, always take the tab and will gladly buy things for others.Benefit - Any money that you donate to charity or pay with the curses drawback is put into a “good will” fund. At any time you can call upon this fund to have some non magic positive (and somewhat realistic) occurrence to happen of your choosing. For example you could have a pair of horses delivered to you in your hour of need, then subtract the cost of two horses from your fund. If you sell these gifts then your good will fund immediately depletes and goes negative equal to double the gold gained from selling the gifts.Drawback - Whenever you spend gold (not including your good will), you spend an additional 20% more gold to make whoever you’re paying happy. You cannot intentionally and knowingly steal money or possessions from others, or participate in plans to do so.Special - Some scenarios related to this curse are left up to interpretation. If you wanna make a cool heist mission where you're stealing from a tomb then you can realistically make an exception. But if you’re just casting buffs on a rogue while they rob people blind, that’s a no go. Realistic for the benefit just means no milk delivery when cows are extinct. If the player can come up with a creative way to get what they want, then you should give it to them, or increase the cost.HonestYou just can't help but speak the truth. Those afflicted with the honest curse are rarely trusted with secrets. Their honesty is seen as a virtue to many, but it gets them into trouble quite often when they suddenly start getting quiet, or worse, when they run their mouth.Benefit - When you surpass the DC of a sense motive check to detect if someone is lying by 5, they automatically blurt out the truth.Drawback - You cannot knowingly tell a lie. Not even a half-truth. You are compelled to answer questions to the best of your knowledge. The best you can do to not reveal your deepest secrets is to not speak at all.HornyYour mind is often filled with lustful thoughts. Those afflicted with the horny curse often tell dirty jokes and hit on anything with a pulse. Worse yet they tend to have deviant tastes.Benefit - You gain post nut clarity. After nutting/helping someone achieve nut, you may glean information from your intimate bond. You effectively ask a question and receive an answer in three or less words. The subject does not know you gleaned this information.Drawback - Your partner also gets to glean information with the same restrictions. You know what they gleaned.Identity CrisisWho are you? Those afflicted with the identity crisis curse are really good at not being themselves. Thoughtful parents give their lil’ curse bearers unisex names.Benefit - You can assume the form of any playable race with a duration of one hour 1/day. It doesn’t affect your racial features. You cannot choose to look like the other you (see drawback).Drawback - Every monday morning you wake up as a new person, swapping between two different people. In your head you’re still you, but you look completely different. You still stay the same race, but you swap genders, change size and shape, eye color, all the above and more! You take a -5 penalty to any skill check to convince someone that you're still you if they haven't experienced both yous a few times or aren't a close friend, family etc.LonerYou just want to be alone. Those afflicted with the loner curse are physically drained when in the presence of other people, and thrive when left to their own devices. Confrontation is terrible, especially when they have to do the confronting.Benefit - You get a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws when you aren't being threatened and no allies are adjacent to you. When you aren't in the presence of other creatures you get a +2 bonus to skill checks. Something like a familiar, companion creature or a pet can be a reasonable exception.Drawback - You take a -2 penalty to any opposed skill check. You cannot benefit from or provide flanking and assist other bonuses.MuteYou’d love to chat, if only you could. Those afflicted with the mute curse cannot speak, but are much better at developing intimate connections with those you physically interact with.Benefit - You can cast spells while silenced. You learn sign language as a bonus language. You can telepathically communicate via touch. Your communication happens simultaneously to all creatures touched. While in direct contact with someone, you have advantage on skill checks against them.Drawback - Whenever you spend gold (not including your good will), you spend an additional 20% more goObliviousYou have no idea how bad things really are. Those afflicted with the oblivious curse have things fly right over their heads all the time, sometimes to their benefit!Benefit - You get a +4 bonus versus fear effects. You get a +4 bonus to ac and saving throws until you act in combat. These bonuses stack. Whenever making a saving throw out of combat, also add these bonuses.Drawback - You take a -4 penalty on perception and sense motive. You do not gain perception as a skill. You cannot gain perception or sense motive as skills from any source.PossessedYou share your body…Literally! Those afflicted with the possessed curse have another creature's spirit inhabiting their body. Luckily this spirit has a sense of self-preservation, but it does like having some personal space…Your personal space.Benefit - When you are stunned, paralyzed, unconscious or suffering from a similar kind of status effect that prevents you from acting, you can still do anything that only requires the use of a single arm (such as drink potions, swing a one-handed weapon or manipulate an object). You still cannot cast spells while CC’d. You have a speed of 5 feet while suffering from such conditions.Drawback - You only have access to one of your arms. Your off-hand cannot be used to wear a shield, wield a weapon or perform complex tasks that generally require two hands.SPECIAL - The DM and player should consider the creature that is possessing the limb and perhaps during special moments, or while doing something the possessor likes, the spirit concedes control of the limb to its original owner.RetrospectiveYou’re always dwelling on the past. Those afflicted with the retrospective curse constantly reminisce about the great things that happened in their past. By the same token, the negative events that happen to them weigh heavy on their mind for much longer than most.Benefit - You are immune to effects that magically alter your memory. You recall everything you have ever experienced with perfect clarity. You can cast mirror movie (Larella 4) at-will (self only).Drawback - When you are suffering from an affliction, any numeric penalties are doubles. If it does not have a numerical penalty, it takes twice as long, or costs twice as much as normal to cure because the memory of your tragedies are so vivid.RacistYou hate x people. Those afflicted with the racist curse generally have a disdain for creatures that don’t look and talk like them. They channel this distaste into hatred for a few in particular.Benefit - Choose 3 playable races. When in combat against them, increase your speed to 120. You have advantage on any opposed checks against these creatures, so long as such interactions can be considering "unfriendly." (aka, no persuasion or something like it)Drawback - As long as a creature of this race is standing, you must end each of your turns threatening one if you are physically able. You must use all of your actions to harm and impede these creatures. If you can't, then dash to move closer to them.TwinnedYou're like brothers, only closer. Those afflicted with the twinned curse come with a +1. They have 2 heads and share control over the body.Benefit - You have a commoner attached to you that matches your level (see bestiary&gt;humanoids). You have primarily control of your body and your head has no actions of its own, but can still sense normally and speak. This gives you access to 3 more skills, one of which must be profession, and potentially new race features. As an instant action, your other head can shove you 5 ft 1/minute. They can also perform simple interactions such as grabbing things, opening doors etc using this same cooldown.Drawback - You must concede control of your body in order to use these bonus skills/race features. This requires a free action. Your other head can concede control similarly, or you can forcefully take control by making your other head pass a will save 1/minute. You can also shove them.
When your other head is in control it uses its own stat array, skill bonuses, racial features etc. This happens automatically while you are sleeping and the other head isn't, though most loud/physical activities will wake you up.Special - Because this curse requires cooperation, using it to fuse with enemies can be very challenging. Proceed with caution.]]></description><link>classes/psychic/fate-spinner/curses.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/psychic/fate-spinner/curses.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Many people wish they could see the future, but the fate spinners are the only ones who truly understand the nature of this burden. Fate spinners are frequently humbled by their power to see into the future and the struggle to change it. You gain unique boons with drawbacks associated with them, and a deck of cards to twist fate with on a whim.{% hint style="info" %}
Class DC changes from Int to Luck {% endhint %}ArtFeaturing Mollymauk from Critical Role by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://x.com/electrocereal/status/1090666277079785472" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://x.com/electrocereal/status/1090666277079785472" target="_self">Electrocereal</a><br><img data-size="original" alt="" src=".html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self">Draw a card from your deck as a swift action. See card results for more details.Fatespinners, oracles and the like tend to draw the ire from the gods for meddling with the future. They each suffer from a unique curse that provides them with unique challenges and benefits. See the curses section for more details.Your mind is plagued by visions of the future. During carefully curated rituals, speaking in tongues, wild highs on psychoactive drugs or delivered in dreams, you receive premonitions about future events. These premonitions generally focus on great tragedies soon to befall subjects that are relevant to you. This could be important people, places of significance, valuable artifacts, ancient evils and other such things.As far as fine mechanics go, the ritual requires at least one hour of uninterrupted concentration. Generally the subject of these premonitions are focused around a specific subject, sometimes of your choosing, sometimes not. The premonitions are not required to give a precise answer.This next part is as much for the DM as it is the player.As an example. You could divine things about the organization causing strife in this city.
"Suddenly you are far away in the nation's capital city. You see brief flashes of the decorations of the summer festival, and a dark amorphous blob moving through the streets. You see many silhouettes moving into the kings castle. The only discernible detail you can see from them is an insignia on the hood of their robes. You hear a voice. 'Today is the day the tyrant is killed.' And then the vision transforms into a beautiful oasis filled with winged horses, before quickly fading."Some important takeaways…
You ALWAYS focus on the event, not the outcome. In order to be a premonition given to presumably change the future, the information must be actionable. (the king is danger!)
You ALWAYS know the WHEN of the event, down to the minute. Other details like where and who can be discovered. (its happening during the summer festival!)
You ALWAYS receive some kinds of sensory clues. Voices, symbols, colors, smells, temperature must be present. (robed figures with a noticeable insignia, some large black ooze and the voice of someone important)
You ALWAYS receive something that you can affect within the prescribed time. Either the vision tells you about something nearby,or the vision also includes similar types of clues for how you might get to these faraway places. (you'd never be able to get there in time…unless you could fly using a pegasus)
As for the [recharge] tag. Depending on the pacing of your campaign, your premonitions might reveal information regarding events that are to happen within weeks, months or years. Generally a fate spinner should have a premonition once each major story arc. No matter what though, a fate spinner cannot have premonitions about a new subject before the events of his current premonition transpire.If you or your DM deem this ability too annoying or disruptive for play...gain an extra technique point and then another each odd level.Fatespinners have an innate sense of how far they can push fate before fate pushes back. You gain a pool of 10 luck. Whenever you add luck to a roll, you can choose to add any amount of this luck pool to the roll. You can add this luck after you fail a check, with your GM telling you how much is needed to pass the check.This pool resets to 10 when you rest.You can push your luck, going negative up to 10 points. Whenever you do, you gain a unique affliction.T3 Affliction: Out of Luck - You cannot add luck to your rolls.Cure - Pay homage to the gods to make up for meddling in their affairs. You must do this a number of days equal to your negative luck pool when you gained this affliction. Paying homage can include spending time at a place of worship or assisting leaders of a religion.{% hint style="warning" %}
Note, because you can no longer add luck to rolls with this affliction, you also cannot use your fated luck pool. This means when you go negative, even if only -1, you cannot then later choose to go even more negative.
{% endhint %}You can see the silvery thread that floats above a creatures head, connecting them to the heavens above. This thread is loosely connected to other people, locations and objects. Unless a creature is also a fate spinner, you can wrap this thread around your finger without bringing much attention to yourself while within 10 ft of them, tethering you to the creature. While tethered...
You can always follow this thread to lead you to this person. The thread is ethereal and ignores physical terrain, leading in a direct line to this creature, causing potential problems when tracking someone in a dense building, underground or on the other side of world.
When in the presence of people, places or objects of significance to the creature, you can see faint threads connecting their tether to them.
The tethered creature remembers you very clearly from any previous encounter you had with them after you tethered to them, even events that happened before the tether.
You can only tether to a single creature at a time, losing any previous ties if you tether a new creature.]]></description><link>classes/psychic/fate-spinner/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/psychic/fate-spinner/README.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=".html" length="0" type="text/html"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=".html"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[glass-reflection]]></title><description><![CDATA[This ability comes online at level 1, and improves at levels 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.By performing a 1 hour ritual using a reflective surface, such as a mirror or a pool of water, you can see and hear remote locations. To do so you must name a specific creature you have met personally (Zeus, Jake from State Farm, Boo the miniature giant space hamster). You see the target creature as though you were floating overhead, using your own senses (will negates). Your vision radius is limited to only 10 ft around the target, but you can hear things as though you were present.Passing a save against Glass Reflection (GR) gives the target an eerie feeling that they're being watched. Failing means they are unaware.Possessing a personal possession of the creature (a book, weapon, article of clothing) gives them a -2 penalty to their save. Possessing a piece of the creature, such as a hair or some of their blood, gives them a -4 penalty. These penalties do not stack.The range of this ability is finite. Generally speaking it should only function on creatures within city limits. This generally means it has a range of a few miles. You can spy on a creature for 10 minutes before the senor disappears. You can speak <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/monster-qualities/other-traitss#telepathy-su" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/monster-qualities/other-traitss#telepathy-su" target="_self">telepathically</a> to creatures visible in your GR.You cannot target an unwilling creature with GR more than 1/day. A creature who has passed a save against your GR before always gets a perception check to see signs of magical spying with a DC (20+lvl) perception check when you initiate it. Without ways of interacting with magic they can do little to stop you, but they know you're there.<br>By contacting a creature ahead of time (such as via <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/larella/level-1/sending" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/larella/level-1/sending" target="_self">sending</a>), you can automatically scry on a willing target without accepting mana burn.The first use of Glass Reflection each day does not mana burn.Any effects that prevent or otherwise interact with [scrying] effects also interact with GR.
You don't need to have personally met the target of your spying, but you do still need to know their name
The range of this effect increases to state. If you're within the same state, it works. This generally means a few dozen miles.
You get a +4 bonus to perception while scrying a creature
You gain nightvision during GR You no longer need to know the name of the creature you spy on, but you do need some kind of vague idea of who
they are. Something like "the guild leader of the Fox Force" or "the orc general" suffices. The range of this ability increases to country. This generally means hundreds of miles You can spy on a creature for 1 hour The GR ritual only takes 10 minutes The range of this ability increases to continent. This generally means a thousands of miles
The vision radius increases to 20ft around the target
You gain darkvision during GR
Creatures you have successfully GR'd before have disadvantage on saving throws and perception checks against GR You can use GR on creatures on the entire planet, other planets and other planes of existence
You can spy on a creature until you rest
The GR ritual only takes 1 minute The GR ritual only takes 1 standard action

See subsection for details.As long as you have a clear view of a creature and you understand the language that it's speaking, you need not hear it to understand it.Choose a level 0 fiend, celestial or fey, or create a beast that is automatically tiny using the Beast Trainer's Beast Companion feature. It's level is always 0. If it aids you in combat, it gains the [companion] tag. You can also use your familiar to do a handful of other useful things.Spying [scrying] - You can sense through your companion at will.

Assistant - Your companion can use the aid action to assist you for any skill checks.
To My Side [teleportation] - You can concentrate for 3 rounds to teleport your companion to your side.When a creature fails a save against an effect you inflict, or you land an attack, you can affect the creature as though you had successfully cast detect thoughts on them as an immediate action. You briefly gain insight into their current plans, something that weighs heavily on their mind, or whatever seems most relevant at the time.Alternatively, you can roll a knowledge check (including monster lore) using the creatures bonus. You intuitively know what knowledge skills it possesses.Get a +2 bonus to perception.You can pluck out your eye as a standard action and have it hover around autonomously with a speed of 40 on each of your turns. It has a tether range of 300 ft. You can pop it back into your head as an instant action if it moves into your space. You can simultaneously see through both your eye and your detached eye without mental strain.The eye is blurry and insubstantial so it always has partial concealment. To perceive it, creatures need to make a DC 20 perception check, or DC 10+your stealth bonus.It shares all of your statistics and is treated as you for all targeting purposes. AoE effects targeting both you and your eye only affect you once.You are persistently under the effect of detect thoughts allowing you to always peer into the thoughts of others. It loses the concentration tag and gains the [buff] tag. If gain another buff, you can reactivate detect thoughts as a swift action.Thi]]></description><link>classes/psychic/spy/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/psychic/spy/README.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[disco]]></title><description><![CDATA[Your psyche is fragmented, rendering some parts of your brain inaccessible. This allows them to develop thoughts on their own, and chime in with their own insights when the situation calls for it. As a result, disco psychics are able maintain multiple trains of thought, giving unique insights into situations that surpass leaps of logic and enter the realm of the supernatural.Your mind is fragmented into 4 different parts: The self, the body, instinct and intellect. Each part of your mind is special in its ability to focus on specific things.
The self is related to charisma, and represents an aspect of yourself that gets along with others. Things such as cooperation, empathizing and commanding others.
The body is related to str/dex, and represents an aspect of yourself that interacts with material reality. Repairing or breaking things, flexing on people and sleight of hand.
Instinct is related to wisdom, and represents an aspect of yourself that can see the unseen. Things such as gut feelings and hunches.
Intellect is related to intelligence, and represents an aspect of yourself that knows information. Things such as logic, mathematics and knowledge.
As an instant action before you roll a skill check, you can choose to add a d8 to it. If you fail the check, you lose a point of Mental Might. You cannot use this when you take 10/20.The fragments of your mind have much to say, but they can be pushed even further beyond. You can choose to invoke a particular fragment of your psyche. When you do spend a point of Mental Might. Roll a d8 and add the key ability score (choosing between str or dex as appropriate for the situation for the body). If the final result totals 6 or higher, you learn a far greater amount of information that you otherwise would have, or succeed in some other superlative fashion. If you fail, you glean nothing.For example if you invoke the self during a war meeting to convince an enemy to agree to an armistice you might get something like...
"The general is in a very difficult position. All the posturing and propaganda surrounding the war could fall apart if he agrees to this armistice. Worse yet, he could appear weak to his people; A death sentence to any military career, and this mans ambitions are high. If you want to convince him to an armistice, you need to do so in a way that doesn't shatter his reputation. Perhaps you should bring up that common enemy you have both been on the hunt for."Another example if you invoke intellect in order to detect any patterns in an ongoing investigation on some wanted criminal you might get something like...
"You are looking at the map and suddenly it all clicks. A circle! The attacks are all happening in cities along the outskirts in the country's territory. It reminds you of a much larger version of the circles you've seen with the cultists. The only part left of the circle is the center...The capital!"In any case, you receive a large degree of information that might be available to your character, or can be gleaned from the clues you have seen up until this point, but might not click in your head as a player. Your GM may want to assign bonuses or penalties based on circumstances. A -1 for previously insulting the general or +1 for studying the magic circles in a library to use the previous examples.{% hint style="warning" %}
The GM is the final arbiter in deciding whether or not you can invoke psyche at all. For example, you cannot invoke intellect to figure out who is the leader of a secret organization you know nothing about session 1.
{% endhint %}You can invoke aspects of your psyche to perform incredibly unusual feats. You gain an invocation at level 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Each one is color coded to decide which stat applies.Shivers - The wind holds omens of the future, and you can feel it. You always invoke shivers when you want to find something. When you successfully invoke instinct with shivers, you get insight into the type of place whatever it is you are looking for is. You usually must still put clues together in order to narrow it down.Schizophrenia - The world itself speaks to you. You always invoke schizophrenia on objects of great significance. When you successfully invoke schizophrenia, the chosen object speaks to you. The frame of time it does so varies, but it typically only does so for 1 sitting. The object can relay information about creatures that have interacted with it in the past, like a piano of a musician or a sword of an ancient hero. Visualization - Reshape the scene. You always invoke visualization to piece together how something played out based on physical traces left behind. When you successfully invoke visualization, you can re-imagine an event as it happens, with the vague silhouettes of creatures and objects moving in real time to allow you to determine details like size, shape, sequence and direction.Activation - Start your engines. You always invoke activation in order to activate something. This could mean some kind of complex machine you normally couldn't make heads or tails of, how to open a door with no obvious handle or swing open a portcullis from outside of a fort. Activation may require a specific position or suitable tool to get full value.Mirror - Watch how it's done. You always invoke the mirror when you want to copy someone. You can mimic someones ability to quell an animal, speak a language or perform some type of skill. In any case, your mirror neurons can only do their magic if you have witnessed a creature in action within the last 10 minutes. You mimic the degree of success you witnessed, can speak the language for the duration of a conversation and otherwise temporarily mimic some behavior.Encyclopedia - Master of all trivia. You can invoke encyclopedia whenever you wish, and your brain produces random tidbits of information. When you succeed, you receive relatively detailed information about something specific, though it may not be what you were hoping for...Roll a luck check.Lets pretend you are walking around a museum cataloguing ancient monsters called "Big Beasties"
1-6 - Your brain produces information completely unrelated to the situation at hand. Encyclopedia decides to inform you about a loving relationship between a lady and a giant ape.
7-13 - Your brain produces information tangentially relevant to the situation at hand. Encyclopedia tells you about other large creatures that exist and how the specimens you're looking at stack up to them.
14-20 - Your brain produces rather precise information about the situation at hand. Encyclopedia informs you about one of the specimens and its historical significance while it was still living.

You gain a Potential Pool. You can sacrifice money, inventory space and carry weight, gambit slots, spend time, visit places, and place yourself in beneficial situations to add to this pool. The possibilities are nearly limitless. It is intentionally nebulous, and what you do with your money and time is undetermined until you use your Mastermind ability.Once you have a good amount of resources in this pool, you can, as a free action at any time, produce a flashback to a time when you used them to produce an item or outcome in the current situation. For example, if you have a month of time and some gold in the pool, you can recall a time when you took courses in a language that is being spoken in the moment, and retroactively record what your actions were to perfectly tailor them to the situation. As long as the plan is simple, realistic, and easily achieved, you need only spend your resources to cause the event to happen. If it's a bit more complex, such as sneaking items into a location, you can expend resources to try and get it to happen, but may need to roll a skill check to have it be successful; otherwise, you lose any potential that you would have used attempting to succeed at that task.This ability has a cooldown of 5 minutes. Exceptionally cheap or mundane items/plans have no cooldown.Gain a pool of D8 dice (1+1/2 lvl+Int) . These can be used on any physical ability check or skill check, saving throw, or attack roll, even after learning the results of the check to make it succeed retroactively.
This ability cannot be used to exceed what would otherwise be the maximum result (such as 28 for d20+8).While wearing any clothes with pockets, your inventory (that isn't exposed to the world) functions as an arcane pocket with 20 extra pounds. If someone thoroughly searches you, you may use Sleight of Hand to conceal the presence of any items on you.Tip: When added to your Potential Pool, you may use Mastermind to retroactively determine that your inventory is empty after a failed attempt to conceal it, after which you must place yourself in a situation to add it back to your Potential Pool. This is the origin of the ability's name.Gain Sleight of Hand as a free skill with a +4 bonus. You can roll sleight of hand instead of deception when feinting creatures.You may use Sleight of Hand in place of a Profession skill of your choice (typically related to illicit or dubiously moral activities, or businesses that tend to facilitate such). This ability counts as having the Profession skill for qualification purposes.When you successfully hit a DD creature, you may use your Cunning Action to cast Dispel Magic on them, targeting a [buff] spell they have on themselves. If you succeed, you steal the buff for its remaining duration. If it was also [concentration], you begin concentrating on it.Immediately gain 10% of your character's current wealth as bonus wealth that appears in your Potential Pool. Upon finding any loot or income in the future, even as a party, you automatically gain 10% of the loot's value added to your pool. Up to GM discretion to determine what counts, to avoid farming wealth with recurrent sales and repurchases.]]></description><link>classes/rogue/mastermind.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/rogue/mastermind.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ninja]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ninjas are a special breed of rogues that heavily focus around using a set of supernatural powers that aid them in espionage and misdirection. Their signature ability, shadow clone, makes them able to exist in many places at once, vastly increasing their ability to gather information.Not historically accurate, but its more fun this way C:You can spend a standard action to cause an exact copy of yourself to appear in an adjacent space. A brief cloud of smoke appears to obscure who the real one is (flip a coin to see if you target the one you intend to). If you are hiding when you do this, so is the clone. In most aspects, the creature functions exactly as you do with respect to things like attack, damage, saving throws etc. Whenever they expend a resource, such as mana, a consumable item, or ammunition, it gets expended for you as well, including contributing to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/#using-multiple-techniques-a-turn" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/#using-multiple-techniques-a-turn" target="_self">cap on techniques used per turn</a>. The clone gets all of its own actions, it reasons just as well as you do and follows your direct orders, but you have no supernatural ability to communicate with it over long distances.The clone automatically disappears when it fails a saving throw against anything or takes any damage. When the clone dies, or you dismiss it, you instantly gain all of its memories back, as though you had experienced the events yourself. There is no range limit on how far the clone can get from you. If a creature has reason to suspect you aren't the real you, they roll perception vs your class DC or 10+your disguise bonus, whichever is higher.You can have a maximum of 1 shadow clone out at once. When you make a shadow clone, you are still the "real you" and the clone is still a fake. Remembering your clone's experiences can be traumatic. If one is killed, roll a DC 9 luck check. On a fail, gain an affliction. You (or the clone itself on mission complete) can cause a clone to safely disappear as a free action.{% hint style="warning" %}
This ability is incredibly versatile and has the ability to completely warp the game. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to exploit this ability, but the DM should not be afraid to not let certain things work. For instance, if you share the same resources and then a clone sits in a nearby safe place to spam some kind of mana restoration effect. This is clearly against the spirit of the ability. Don't let it happen.
{% endhint %}You can start concentrating on this ability as a free action.
As long as you only move during your turn and take no other action, you can walk along any flat continuous surface. This can include things that aren't even otherwise solid such as water or lava. It can also include things such as walls or ceilings.You can use this ability for only part of your turn to get to a location, but if you attack, cast a spell etc, then you need be on a surface you would normally be able to stand on or you plummet.<br>While you stand completely still and take no action on your turn, you are affected as per <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-6/invisibility" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-6/invisibility" target="_self">invisibility</a> until you do. This can also happen if you are unable to move or take actions, such as when stunned.<br>You can spend 2 mana as a swift action to use shadow clone to instantly create 3 clones, but they do not leave your space or scar you on death. This functions as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/wildcard/level-2/mirror-images" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/wildcard/level-2/mirror-images" target="_self">mirror image</a>.By spending 2 mana and your cunning action, you can create a cloud of dense smoke in a 10 ft radius around you and hide. It typically only lasts a 3 rounds, but can last 1 in windy environs or it doesn't work at all during storms. Other types of [air] effects can cause it to disperse more quickly as well.<br>By spending 3 mana as an immediate action, you can cause an unattended object within 30 ft of you to be the target of your attack instead of you, such as a log, furniture etc. You take the place of the object you used and you immediately <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-1/vanish" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-1/vanish" target="_self">vanish</a> until the end of your next turn.Shadow Clone gains the [scrying] tag, allowing you to witness what they see while concentrating.]]></description><link>classes/rogue/ninja.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/rogue/ninja.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Masters of stealth, infiltration and execution.

This event is harmful and sudden, such as a lightning strike on a clear day, a large creature falling on them from the sky or a brick falling loose from the wall next to them. They take 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) and are clumsy 1 (reflex halves dmg and negates clumsy). The damage type depends on the effect, but the damage can never be something that the target has resistance or immunity to.The DC increases by 2 if you use this ability after the target says something like "that would never happen" or "may the gods strike me down if my cause is not righteous" or something to that effect.Recharges after 1 minute.If you miss or graze a creature while threatening another creature, you can choose to instead roll a new attack against the second target as an immediate action. If the initial target was DD, so is the secondary target.You can escape manacles, vines, webs, rope, grapples and more using sleight of hand instead of the usual method. If you would normally escape through athletics, then use the athletics DC. If you are grappled, then roll sleight of hand opposed to the grappling creatures reflex save. If there is not predetermined action type for the effect, it is a standard action.You gain advantage on this check while nobody is watching you.
You can also use this to assist an ally to escape from these conditions too.When a creature you can see fails a skill check, you can spend 1 mana to "try it yourself." You automatically achieve their result and add your luck to it. If you succeed, you remove the mana burn.Certain places are well known for particular events. Markets have big sales, shady bars have fights, lively inns have parties etc. You can roll an appropriate skill check in order to spark such events. Roll profession to start a fire sale, roll intimidation to goad some drunkards into a scrap or roll perform to get people dancing. This can apply to any number of situations and skill rolls like prison riots, chanting crowds, sea shanties etc.The DC is 20. The effect is usually to stir people up in public places, so without others present, this doesn’t do much. These events are usually temporary only lasting a few minutes.1/day, choose a location, person or item you can see with 60 ft. Whenever an event of significance happens to the thing you chose, such as a creature cracking at your safe, walking into an abandoned building or petting your dog, you can choose to roll serendipity to happen to be in the nearby area to witness it happen. What is considered "significant" can have a higher degree of specificity, such as "an orc pets my dog," but it increases the DC.This usually only allows you to attend to things in your nearby area, such as in your city. When you succeed on serendipity, you happen to wake up to use the bathroom, you do a late night milk run or you got a tip in advance. Typically the DC is 10, with circumstances such as distance, specificity, what you are doing when the event happens and how accessible what you chose to keep your eye on can increase the DC, with unfavorable circumstances adding +2, and downright ridiculous ones (like being in a prison after visiting hours) adding +4, up to a maximum of DC 20.Certain physical limitations, such as being unable to keep tabs on something a country away, can make using this ability impossible. You can keep tabs on (1+luck) things at a time.As a free action, end the knockdown condition.By spending 1 hour doing research or practicing, you can become proficient in a particular skill for the rest of the day. Certain skills may require facilities or equipment in order to properly practice (such as a library for knowledge skills, or thieves tools for sleight of hand).You can sell any item, no questions asked, so long as you are in a place you could consider a city. While inside of a city, you can also spend a few hours to figure out the kinds of illegal things that people sell there such as things related to forbidden magic, or human trafficking, and where you can purchase said items.You have enough street cred to trade with such vendors without requiring any checks. If you unearth this operation, such as by telling proper authorities or the public, you lose this street cred. This also happens if an ally you bring does so. Whenever you sell an item, you get 60% of the items value instead of 50% by default.You can spend a daily use of stroke of luck to cause an unattended, loose handheld object within 60 ft to instantly end up in your hands. The way this happens is usually very dramatic and unlikely, changing based on the scenario. A plank in the floor goes loose, catapulting a key towards you when someone steps nearby. A leak springs in your ship next to you, causing the item to spill out.You never need to roll to achieve the desired result.]]></description><link>classes/rogue/rogue-talents.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/rogue/rogue-talents.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[thug]]></title><description><![CDATA[As a free action once per round, use Intimidate to Demoralize.

Fast healing requires a check that only adds the creatures level, and regen makes that check with advantage. Can also be healed with the medicine skill, or healing abilities, usually requiring a CL check to heal the wound.You can use your intimidation bonus in place of your persuasion bonus to persuade and gather information.

A secret identity usually has a very unusual outfit, and it always covers the face. Changing between your normal and secret identity requires 3 rounds and some privacy, lest the secret is revealed. Only a handful of trusted individuals are privy to the vigilantes true identity.When using your secret identity, you change your mannerisms, voice, clothes and even more dramatic things about your appearance, making you unrecognizable to even your closest friends. Even magic cannot distinguish the two. For example if you are asked about information only told to your true identity, truth detecting magic cannot tell the user of any lies about what you know. Magical attempts to locate your secret identity fail if you are in your true identity etc.If you are defeated or otherwise incapacitated and a creature takes a FRA to reveal you while in your secret identity, they can discover your true identity. Creatures that know your true identity ignore your resistance to magical and nonmagical detection by swapping identities.For vigilantes that stick in one place, they can spend 1 week to locate/create a location secluded from the surrounding area. Located in sewers, caves, abandoned buildings and the like, the secret lair is a safe location. Any mundane attempts to find the lair must beat a DC (25+lvl) check to locate it. Such attempts usually cannot be made without some kind of hint, such as chasing you as you return to it. Magic to locate the lair, or anybody inside, automatically fails.The lair can be quite spacious, large enough to fit training areas, holding cells for your enemies and vaults for your valuables. There are several methods of reaching your lair from different locations. If needed, you can empty your secret lair within a day.You have connections with a talented engineer that can fashion you a unique vehicle. This vehicle is very sturdy and large enough to comfortably hold 6 medium creatures, in addition to you. You get access to 3 different mobility upgrades from the pilot archetype of mechanic.If the vehicle is targeted with any attacks or harmful effects then use your saves, AC, etc to figure out what happens. The vehicle is treated as an object to determine how it is affected by harmful effects. It has half your hp. If it falls to 0, it is inoperable.You have a 6th sense for specific sights and sounds that indicate people require your assistance such as a symbol displayed in the clouds from a light, or a type of whistle. You can sense these automatically when they happen within a mile of you, and you know its exact position. 1/day when such a signal occurs, you can change into your secret identity and travel to where the signal happened from within 1 minute.]]></description><link>classes/rogue/vigilante.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/rogue/vigilante.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[goober]]></title><description><![CDATA[{% hint style="info" %}

Moving at the same speed, being able to carry the same amount, being able to speak, having the same senses etc.As a swift action, you can abandon your amorphous qualities in order to assume the roundabout humanoid shape that you used to have, albeit with a much more gooey aesthetic. Whenever you shapeshift into other creatures, you maintain this gooey aesthetic.Only functions against ooze creatures.As a standard action, you can sacrifice half of your current and max hp to split into two copies of yourself. It functions exactly as you, expending your resources such as mana, limited uses per day items and abilities, consumable items etc.TLDR; This ability does not generate more resources.Your copy is a minion version of you (making it 1/3 your level).

Both creatures are dazed for 1 round (fort negates daze).]]></description><link>classes/shapeshifter/goober.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/shapeshifter/goober.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[polymorph]]></title><description><![CDATA[These points are often used through other features and are referred to as adaptation points. ]]></description><link>classes/shapeshifter/polymorph.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/shapeshifter/polymorph.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unleash the power of the wilds.

These technique points can be used on the beastmode tree.Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique.You have (3+lvl) shapeshift charges. As a swift action, consume one to gain a series of ANY benefits from the polymorph list. Each of these qualities has a point value associated with them. You have (3+lvl) points to choose abilities with. These points are often used through other features and are referred to as adaptation points.The effects last an hour and are permanent @6. All benefits are replaced the next time you use it.While under the effects of a [poly, baleful] effect, you can use shapeshift to immediately end it and still benefit from shapeshift as normal.See subsection for all abilities. You have access to all the charts, unless it shares the name with an archetype.You possess claws on your hands that you can sheathe and unsheathe. This natural attack deals 2d6 slashing damage while your hands are empty, or d10 if they are not. Typically while shapeshifted (using the true polymorph version) you can't wield weapons, shields etc so the damage is always 2d6. Any other natural attacks that you gain through this class shares this damage, but often with a different damage type. These claws persist through shapeshift, transforming into another form of attack if the creature doesn't have a similar pair of limbs to adapt to (rhino, lion).Your claws share the properties of a single weapon in your position, such as magic enchantment, a magic focuses ability to cast spells, or special attacks. You can bond to a new weapon with a 1 minute ritual requiring concentration and contact with the weapon.Make two attacks, one of which must be with your shifter claws.Gain the wild empathy feat.Aside from being a secret language, druidic can only be read by other creatures that know druidic. You can essentially write secret messages by touching your finger to any natural object (typically boulders and trees) and writing. Any message written in this way can be erased by a creature that knows druidic with ease.You can speak with beasts as though you shared a common language. They are able to much better articulate their feelings as though they possessed the intellect of a simple humanoid, but their instincts, desires and attitude toward you remain largely the same.You gain the service of a specific animal to aid you on your journey. It grows more powerful as you do. More rules on beast companions in the beast companion section of beast trainer.Its level is 1/3 your level.You cannot be DD unless feinted, stunned, or otherwise completely prevented from taking actions.You can spend a shapeshift charge to get an overall hunch of a creature or terrain by picking up on things others might miss, like sudden changes in the wind, the absence of animal sounds or subtle scents.When used against a creature, you learn whether the creature is interested in taking advantage of you, interested in helping you, or not particularly interested in you. You don't learn about their plans, only their relation to you. If the creature is a beast, you also learn if it is polymorphed.When you use it on a terrain, its mostly focused on your immediate vicinity or a place you plan to go, such as a cave mouth or the front gate of a town. You learn if the place is dangerous, a safe haven, or neutral. You don't learn why it's dangerous, you just get a bad feeling. If the terrain is natural, you automatically see through any illusions in your direct line of sight.{% hint style="info" %}

Something is "natural" when it is on the mortal plan and it isn't made by sentient creatures. Things like towns and dungeons usually aren't natural.

{% endtabs %}You gain 0 technique points, not usable in any martial tree. You won't need them.
Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique.Fueled by fiendish rituals or blessed by celestial beings, you gain a pool of energy fueled by carnage. You have a maximum of 5 points of energy. You start each day with 5 points. If an ability costs energy, it is marked appropriately. If no cost is listed, assume it costs 1 point.Energy can be restored in 2 ways.
Defeat a creature of at least half your level (restores 1 point)
Successfully glory kill a creature of at least half your level (restores 2 points) You add str instead of dex to for all weapons created by Energy (bigger str means bigger gun)
+10 speed
+4 bonus to athletics
+2 attack, increasing to +4 against fiends.
You can automatically jump as high and as far as you can move.
You are immune to fall damage.
You gain the unarmed combatant and point blank master feats.You can sense weakness in your enemies. Whenever a creature you can see is at or below an hp total equal to (9+lvl), you know. When a creature within 30 feet is at this threshold, you can spend an immediate action to dash with incredible speeds to reach it (in a straight line, even if it is airborne [if you can't fly you fall]) and make an unarmed strike against it. On hit it instantly defeats the creature and you heal (3+lvl) hp.If you so choose, though is completely unnecessary, you can brutally and spectacularly execute whatever creature you just targeted with this ability and they die...Horribly (fort negates). Killing a creature in such a way always results in some amazing feat of strength, agility and a disturbing creativity in the Slayer’s brutality.If this threshold happens to be larger than the health pool possessed by the creature, the Slayer can still use this ability even though they have taken no damage, though he does not heal or regain Argent Energy off of them.Using this energy, you can manifest a powerful double barrel shotgun with a creative attachment. Manifesting the gun is the same as the "swapping gear" action. Merely holding the gun does not require energy, but each shot requires 1 energy. The weapon stats are as follows…DMG - 2d8 P
Properties - 2h
Range - 10 ft (no second increment)<br>
Experimental Rounds - Shots fire in a 10 ft line, functioning like a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/weapon-rules/exotic-weapons#blunderbuss-2d6-pierce-2h-reload-10-lbs-800g" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/weapon-rules/exotic-weapons#blunderbuss-2d6-pierce-2h-reload-10-lbs-800g" target="_self">blunderbuss</a>.
Meat Hook - You can fire a grappling hook at a surface or creature within 30 ft to drag yourself to it as a standard action. If you target a creature, you must make a ranged attack, but when you arrive adjacent to it, you can fire the shotgun or make an unarmed strike against the creature. Meat hook does not require energy.This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest an axe guitar with the following stats…
DMG - 2d8 S
Properties - 2h
Shred - Gain proficiency in performance, but only in playing guitar. +4 when using the shredder.
Riff of Rage - Give all allies within 60 ft +2 attack for 1 round (standard action)
Special Attack: Finale - Declare an attack as a finale. If the attack ends the combat, future finale attacks gain +1 damage permanently. If it does not end the combat, lose 1 damage (minimum 0). A savvy foe can tell how many stacks you have.{% hint style="danger" %}
Finale only stacks in actual combat, not training. You can never passively gain stacks.
{% endhint %}As a free action, move 10 feet, even directly into the air. Can be used multiple times to cover great distances.Augment an unarmed strike that staggers the creature on hit (fort negates). If the attack is successful, enemies within 10 feet of the original target automatically take the attacks damage.This ability can be used in tandem with techniques.This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a rifle with the following stats…
DMG - 2d8 P
Properties - 2h
Range - 30 ft (no second increment)
Zoom - As a FRA, make a single shot with 100 ft range and +2 attack.When you fall at least 20 ft, you release a shockwave in a 10 ft radius around you. If you fell at least 50 ft, the shockwave is a 20 ft radius. The effect this has depends on the target and their HP threshold.Against enemy minions, it sets them to your glory kill threshold. If they are already within the glory kill threshold, they are defeated.Against anything else (including allies), it deals 10 poise damage.As a free action during movement, spend 2 energy to throw a supercharged ball of energy that explodes on impact on the ground, affecting all creatures within 10 ft of the space it lands in. You have 3 types of grenades
[Fire] - Set creatures ablaze (reflex negates).
Frag - Deal (3d6+lvl) crush damage and poise damage. If this breaks poise, the creature is knocked down (reflex halves damage).
[Frost] - Put creatures in stasis for 1 round (reflex reduces to frosty for 1 round).This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a hammer with the following stats…
DMG - 2d8 C
Properties - 2h, CM (Sunder)
Horny Jail - As a standard action, automatically bonk a creature within reach to make them not horny for 1 hour.
Hammer Down [recharge] - 1/combat, strike the ground as a standard action to deal your (d6+d6/odd level) crush dmg and make creatures clumsy 2 within 20 ft (fort halves dmg).
Plunging Attack - If you start your turn above a creature and are not flying/pseudo-flying, you can make a plunging attack. Plunging attack adds 1 damage per 10 feet you fall (max +20 dmg). Plunging attack can also apply to Hammer Down.Weapon attacks gain additional damage equal to their damage dice. Gain this again at level 10
Examples: 2h weapon @1=2d6, @6=4d6, @11=6d6
Light Weapon @1=d6, @6=2d6, @11=3d6This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a hand held ballista with the following stats…
DMG - 2d8 P
Properties - 2h, Siege Weapon
Range - 60 ft (no second increment)
Special Attack: GET OVER HERE! - On hit make a drag attack with a +4 bonus. If successful they are pulled adjacent to you
Siege Mode [recharge] - 1/combat as a FRA charge and release a horizontal slashing energy projectile. Creatures in a 100ft line that is 15 ft wide take (5d8+lvl) slashing damage and start bleeding for 2d8 damage (reflex halves damage and negates bleed).
You can reduce the charge time, making this only require a standard action, but the line is only 5 ft wide.This ability functions as Old Friend, but instead of a shotgun you manifest a sword with the following stats…
DMG - 2d8 S
Properties - 2h, Special Attack: Determination
Melt - As a standard action, cut a hole in a surface of solid or lesser toughness large enough for you to fit through with ease.
Special Attack: Sever - On hit sever an limb from a creature (fort negates).
Arm - Creature is unable to use arm
Leg - Creatures speed is reduced by 15. Clumsy 1 permanently.
Wing - Creature is unable to fly.Other limbs can be selected, disabling natural attacks like tentacles and such. These are just the most common examples.You gain combat reflexes as a bonus feat.You can use glory kill an instant action by consuming an AoO (essentially 3 times round unless you can AoO more somehow).]]></description><link>classes/slayer/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/slayer/README.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=".html" length="0" type="text/html"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=".html"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[sentinel]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Sentinel Slayer trades many of the abilities granted by the original slayer class to pivot the class from an unrelenting aggressor to a more defensive play style.

This is treated as a tower shield and a 1h weapon that can deal slash or crush damage and has the CM (shove) and CM (bully) properties. If this shield is sundered or destroyed, it repairs itself after 1 round. In the hands of a Sentinel, the shield also additional properties. It has the thrown property and 2 enchantment slots, one of which is the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/magic-items/magic-weapon-properties" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/magic-items/magic-weapon-properties" target="_self">returning</a> enchantment, but the returning can be used as an instant action.You can reasonably augment existing shields to also make them better suit your tastes, giving them the above properties.Any offensive ability that deals damage to you, you can parry. Roll an attack roll as an immediate action. Against opposing attack rolls, if you match their roll, you negate it. Against anything else if you match the DC of the ability, you negate it entirely (at least for you in the case of AoE effects).When you successfully parry any ability, you rupture your attacker and any other enemies within 10 ft of them, making them clumsy 2 and setting them to 1 poise.{% hint style="danger" %}
But how do I determine my attack bonus for parrying?You use what your melee attack bonus would be against the target. If you are currently flanking the target, add flanking. If your shield has the bane enchantment against their creature type, add bane.
{% endhint %}As a free action, spend 2 energy to dash directly adjacent to a creature within 30 ft and crash into them, releasing a powerful shockwave. The target creature and all enemies within 10 ft are staggered (fort negates).Instead of a shockwave, you can instead choose to shove the target.When you make a thrown attack with your shield, it embeds itself into a creature on hit, entangling them. If at the end of the creatures turn it is still entangled by this, it takes your shield attack damage again. If you choose to use the returning property of your shield to parry, shield action etc, this entangle ends.When a creature is a minion, you know. You do not need to make attack rolls with your shield against minions. They are automatically crit by your shield attacks. If you defeat a minion with a shield attack, it can bounce to another minion within 20 ft.You gain the shield focus, sentinel and point blank master feats.Inscribe a rune upon your shield to give it additional powers that activate when you successfully parry. You can only activate 1 rune when you parry.
Choose one at this level and another at level 6 and 10,Quaking Rune - All ruptured creatures are also staggered.
Vengeful Rune - Your next onslaught against a ruptured creature costs no energy. If you are within range, you can use onslaught as an instant action.
Celestial Rune - All ruptured creatures are smited by divine power, taking 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) holy damage.
Cursed Rune - All ruptured creatures gain weakness 2 to all damage.
Ligma Rune - All ruptured creatures contract ligma.]]></description><link>classes/slayer/sentinel.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/slayer/sentinel.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chronomancer]]></title><description><![CDATA[Destruction wizards look to win battles by unleashing enormous amounts of damage, usually to large groups of foes.While wielding a spell focus in each hand, you increase your CL by an additional 1 for spells that deal damage.

Those same two brothers and a dragon are 2 sources. 2 brothers, a dragon and a laboratory are 3 sources.Basically there needs to be a variety of sources of inspiration for arcane synergy to function. Each individual can still lend aid, giving a bonus depending on their proficiency. In that same example, your two brothers would collectively give a +6 bonus (2 proficient+2 proficient+2 synergy).

You can choose one of 3 paths, depending on how much effort you are willing to put forth...
You can create your own completely original spell for this spell school. This can be a bit of a daunting task, requiring a degree of trust between game master and player. Once a spell is created, the balancing does not stop there, and should be adjusted as needed to not disrupt the game too much.
Alter an existing spell. Have you ever looked at a spell and wished it was just a little bit different?

These changes are encouraged to alter not only the flavor text, but also the mechanics. Perhaps our boneless-shaker allows you to create the boneless world you desire, tearing out a creatures skeleton leaving them a clumsy blob person. Perhaps a snow woman is more affectionate preferring to get up close and personal, grabbing creatures and keeping them frosty.
In any case, the power of the altered spell should be pretty close to the original, and should serve a similar type of purpose.<br>

{% endtabs %}You gain 3 technique points at level 1, then another 2 points every 2 levels after.
These technique points can be used on the Shira, Moogen and one other tree, chosen at character creation.Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips.As a standard action, you can assume an alternate persona of your creation.
You fabricate a backstory, connections, race, appearance, clothes, voice, the works - this alternate form is completely unique. When you have an alternate persona, you have no "true" form.Your alternate persona has all of your abilities and statistics, but you can decide to swap up to 2 of your skills for any others, and your race may be different. If these changes cause you to no longer qualify for a feat or class feature upon assuming the other form, then you lose access as normal.It takes a week of work to fabricate a new form, and a week to "kill off" an old form. These personas consume your Companion slots, and you may have more than one if you have enough slots. You start off with one alternate persona.Gain deception and disguise as bonus skills.Upon engaging in conversation with a creature for at least one minute, you can call out one detail of its appearance, recent activities (within a day), or mannerisms as a free action. You instantly learn its mental state and intentions as they relate to the detail, within the scope of the totality of information you have on the creature (will negates).Essentially, you correctly guess why a creature did or is doing something. Part of this ability is speaking your guess to the creature, and judging your accuracy off of its response; if it passes its save, you guess wrong, may look silly, and can no longer use this ability on the same creature until you rest. You may substitute the DC with Insight, and the target may substitute its Will save with Deception.As a free action, name a rumor. You gain a sixth sense for who has heard or spread this rumor. If you see the people they told or heard it from, they appear to glow white or red to you, respectively. If you interact with the creature, you can see a literal trail of ethereal energy to the people they either heard the rumor from, or who they told the rumor.Using this ability again negates the previous use.You can amputate a helpless, willing, or recently deceased (within an hour) playable race's face, and spend 500g and 8 hours of labor to convert it into a Maligner's Mask attuned to that specific creature. Most creatures will die or go blind upon having their face amputated without immediate medical attention.When you wear this mask, you partially transform into that creature, which counts as a disguise and grants a +4 bonus skill checks to appear as that specific creature. Putting it on is a full round action, but removing it is a Swapping Gear action. It does not change your clothes or equipment. Other creatures may wear these masks.While you possess a mask, you can use Faceless Monster to create a persona of a person whose mask you possess. If the persona you steal still lives, or is absent for long periods of time, it can cause problems.You can attempt to spread a rumor throughout a small town or larger settlement by attempting a deception check. The difficulty depends on the size, ranging from 10 for a small town to 30 for a metropolis, though this difficulty may be modified if the population as a whole tends towards skepticism or insanity.It takes a week for a rumor to spread. If you succeed by 5 or more, the time is reduced to 3 days. If you fail by 5 or more, the rumor mutates into a competing theory.Each of your personas may only have one rumor brewing at a time.After a minute of concentration, you can enter a state of calm where you deepen your connection with your collection of masks. You can communicate with the fragments of the persons soul left behind within. The masks appear to speak to you, and you can inquire things about these people as though you were a neutral party. As such, they are usually willing to tell you some things, but hesitant for others, usually requiring skill checks. Once you try and pry into something secret and fail, the information is lost forever. The masks are unable to form new memories, and therefore always treat you as they would a stranger, no matter what you ask.]]></description><link>classes/maligner.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/maligner.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=".html" length="0" type="text/html"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=".html"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[mana-addict]]></title><description><![CDATA[A mana addict is an antimage who is well and truly addicted to the power of mana flowing through them.

You can drop this eulogy off on the corpse, the creature's previous home or simply a nearby settlement. This eulogy naturally multiplies, finding itself in newspaper stands, cafes, waiting rooms etc. The less important the creature, the less it spreads. This results in the eulogy being pretty common knowledge for well known people, and the talk of the town for beloved or reviled creatures.You can choose to write or draw anything on this eulogy, but cannot attach any kind of magical spells/traps to it. It must be concise enough to fit on a single standard page.By spending 1 mana as a free action, you can roll out the red carpet for 1 minute. This carpet is 10 ft wide and 60 ft long. It must be placed on a mostly flat, though not necessarily solid, surface. It can also be placed on any surface where carpet is commonly found (such as a staircase). It can be placed on the surface of still(ish) water. It can be used as a bridge to cross a chasm, provided the gap is mostly level.While walking on this carpet, creatures ignore difficult terrain. If you make another carpet, the previous one disappears.You can extend your hand towards a creature and offer to show them the world (or something to that effect). If they willingly take your hand, they are automatically fascinated for up to 5 minutes. During this time you completely obscure their senses from the outside world and take them on a magical journey of your imagining with catchy songs and pretty visuals straight out of a Disney movie.To the outside world it merely looks like you are holding hands with the creature. You can even decide to move the creature around as though you were going for a walk, or dancing at a party. If you move more than 60 ft away from the creatures location, then the fascination ends.By spending 2 mana as a swift action, drop a peculiar grenade on a creature within 30 ft of you that deals 4d6 (14) crush damage to it and then bounces up to 10 ft to a target of your choosing, dealing this damage again. If it defeats the enemy, you can choose another creature within 30 ft for it to bounce to and its damage increases by 2d6 (7).
The grenade can hit a maximum of 4 creatures.When you kill a creature, you see their life flash before your eyes, learning one piece of information.
Greatest regret

Closest companion
Choose a direction and reduce your speed to 0 at the start of your turn. Until you move or are poise broken you can only shoot in that direction (180 degrees), but you can increase your range to 200. Once you shoot a 4th shot, this effect ends.]]></description><link>classes/virtuoso.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/virtuoso.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=".html" length="0" type="text/html"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=".html"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[witch]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Fiend Shifter is someone who has stolen the secrets to the powers of fiends, slowly letting this power overtake them.

Or get crit 3 times in the same combat and survive.Reward - The scars you get from battle are deeply entrenched in your memory. Your memories of combats you have encountered cannot be magically removed.
By touching them, you can perfectly recall past events, as long as they happened in the thick of combat. Other creatures can touch your scars to share in the experience of the memoryBackstabberRequirement - Murder 3 people you once considered allies, or who at thought you were an ally (before you turned on them). If you murder someone in a position of great power, like a powerful guild leader or king, it counts as 3.Reward - You have a 6th sense for when people trust you. By observing how they react to your presence in a brief interaction (such as an introduction), you can tell whether they trust you, are indifferent towards you or if they distrust you.Critical PetRequirement - Use stealth to initiate combat on a creature by patting its head 3 times. This pat can have no mechanical effect such as delivering a spell or attacking.Reward - You unlock the "Pet" skill, usable for memes. It uses your stealth bonus. If you sneak up on a creature and pet their head (again, no additional mechanical effect), you establish dominance, giving you a +2 bonus to skills for the subsequent social or combat encounter. If a creature within reach is smaller than you, you can pet them as a free action 1/turn for no mechanical benefit (no save).]]></description><link>classes-gitbook/classes/achievements.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CLASSES GITBOOK/classes/achievements.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[progression-outside-of-class]]></title><description><![CDATA[Just so its all in one place.Boons/Banes - Gained at level one as a result of having positive or negative luck.Feats - Gained at level 1, and every odd level after.Technique Points - Gain one that can be used on any school of techniques at level 2, and every even level after.Ascendance - Unique template applied at level 12.Achievements - Can be gained at any time, even retroactively, when certain conditions are met, varying based on the achievement]]></description><link>classes-gitbook/classes/progression-outside-of-class.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CLASSES GITBOOK/classes/progression-outside-of-class.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[class-descriptions-completion-status]]></title><description><![CDATA[This section primarily exists to give you a starting point to see what you're interested in.Because this is early access, not all the classes are done

How they survived a bloody conflict, went through incredibly rigorous training to become the best and brightest mage, was chosen by god or some other equally astonishing development. Then the game says "you die in one hit to a goblin."While not entirely unrealistic, it doesn't make for very satisfying gameplay to have your character feel like they are made out of paper and are one stray crit away from instant death. A game like DnD 5e remedies this by making KO'd a state your character falls in and out of multiple times as a result of "le nat 20," spammable low action healing and a lack of negative hit points.If you want the player characters to be invincible compared to monsters of a similar level, I say skip the pretense. Player characters are of a different breed and are hardened by their previous adventures, granting the following benefits…HP - Your hp is increased by 10.
Defeat - You do not have a chance to instantly die when you fall unconscious, instead you receive a stacking debuff called <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://nick-nacks-rpg.gitbook.io/nicknacksrpg.com/the-rules/publish-your-docs-2/defeat" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://nick-nacks-rpg.gitbook.io/nicknacksrpg.com/the-rules/publish-your-docs-2/defeat" target="_self">doom</a>.

There are obviously other factors, but you can't ever keep adventuring without hp. Mana is the general resource system tied to using special abilities, and it naturally recharges when not used.In general healing that keeps you at full HP all the time is intended to be more scarce, and usually come at the cost of reducing your max mana until you rest.In general, only PCs will have this buff. But BBEGs, legendary creatures and other major bosses intended for use at the end of major story beats could also receive a similar version of this buff. Then you can get the juicy "phase transition" threshold to give your big boss encounters more punch.]]></description><link>classes-gitbook/quick-character-creation-guide/main-character-status.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CLASSES GITBOOK/quick-character-creation-guide/main-character-status.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[{% hint style="warning" %}

Ill outline here what a typical class page looks like. Right here I give a brief description of the class.{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Art" %}
This is where I put art I think showcases the class well. I include sources where possible and I draw a lot of it. Click the other tab!
{% endtab %}{% tab title="Basic Stats" %}
Here I include a chart that lets you know some of the important stats related to the classes. Each of these stats are described in the rules section.{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}Most characters will get their core abilities front-loaded at level 1. All classes get access to some type of techniques, whether its martial techniques or spells. Technique points granted through class usually have some form of restriction.Even levels are mostly dedicated to class features that directly increase the classes power. Access to new combat abilities, increasing the power of old ones, getting their own special attacks. Odd levels are mostly dedicated to getting the next tier of techniques. As such, class features are usually sparse. If any are included, they are usually minor increases in power or they are flavorful inclusions.
You also get a feat every odd level.Level 11 is an exception to the odd levels rule where most classes will earn some kind of capstone ability: Something that showcases mastery in whatever fighting style they possess. These features are usually purposefully designed to be overpowered and ridiculous.Level 12 is the level where all player characters acquire ascensions. Ascensions are mostly class agnostic features that add a lot of customization to the final level in the game.
Ascended characters are people that are incredibly significant to the world. These characters are the stuff of legend, and the abilities they acquire represent that. Their weapon becomes legendary, they become a demigod or they develop their own signature fighting style.]]></description><link>classes-gitbook/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">CLASSES GITBOOK/README.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:57:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[TEST]]></title><link>test.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">TEST.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:02:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tactician]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a data-href="Fighter" href="classes/fighter/fighter.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow"><span class="iconize-icon-in-link" title="LiAnchor" aria-label="LiAnchor" data-icon="LiAnchor" aria-hidden="true" style="transform: translateY(20%);"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16px" height="16px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide-anchor"><path d="M12 22V8"></path><path d="M5 12H2a10 10 0 0 0 20 0h-3"></path><circle cx="12" cy="5" r="3"></circle></svg></span>Fighter</a> <a data-href="Archetype" href="classes/+class-details/archetype.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Archetype</a>.<br><a data-href="Crust" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/abbreviations-and-terminology/crust.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Crust</a>tttYtttt.y11]]></description><link>classes/fighter/archetypes/tactician.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/Fighter/Archetypes/Tactician.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 21:23:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bleeding]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bleeding creatures take a specified amount of <a data-href="Damage" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/attacking/damage.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Damage</a> at the start of each of their turns for a specified duration.

I expect you to be traveling through dangerous wilderness, delving into dungeons and stealing treasure from dragons. Some rules, such as skills and mini games, allow you to resolve actions outside of combat, like chases and drinking contests.Where I think Nick Nacks shines is its customization options for players and DMs alike. Instead of having traditional spell lists, I made techniques for both martials and mages, each with their own group loosely centered around a theme such as pyromancy, unarmed fighting or necromancy.I have plans to make far, far more classes, subclasses, bestiary creatures, feats and more!]]></description><link>index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Index.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 18:59:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bloody Finger]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="images/bloody-finger.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>images/bloody-finger.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">IMAGES/Bloody Finger.png</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 18:09:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="images/bloody-finger.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="images/bloody-finger.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Basic Bitch Fighter]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a data-href="Fighter" href="classes/fighter/fighter.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow"><span class="iconize-icon-in-link" title="LiAnchor" aria-label="LiAnchor" data-icon="LiAnchor" aria-hidden="true" style="transform: translateY(20%);"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16px" height="16px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide-anchor"><path d="M12 22V8"></path><path d="M5 12H2a10 10 0 0 0 20 0h-3"></path><circle cx="12" cy="5" r="3"></circle></svg></span>Fighter</a> <a data-href="Archetype" href="classes/+class-details/archetype.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Archetype</a>.For when you really don't want to think about complicated class features.You gain a bonus feat every level.

If a DM makes frequent use of the resurrection spells for entities that the players went to great lengths to kill, it heavily undermines their effort and feels terrible, even if plausible. If all it takes is a bunch of money and a cleric, then rich high level players live in a world without death as a consequence for anybody.Now that we all agree about that, why does resurrection have an expensive material component cost? To punish the players for being unlucky? Why is it locked behind high-level magic? To make playing cleric mandatory? If we only consider the players, then these things become very obvious problems. Players shouldn't be shoehorned into playing specific classes, nor should the money that they worked hard to obtain be required to continue playing the game.The powers that be should instead be very particular about the who gets a second chance. If the players are the main character of the story, then the game's resurrection mechanics should treat them as such. As a replacement for most resurrection effects, use these rules instead. Or don't use resurrection at all. It's your game. Whatever.IMPORTANT NOTE: Please make sure your players are on board with whatever you decide. Nobody likes surprise mechanics.Isn't this just plot armor?
The basic premise of this system of resurrection is that you want player death to have immediate consequences: Not being able to complete a mission or delaying the players long enough so that way the villain can complete the ritual. But you don't want them to have long-term consequences: Not being able to play your character. Having to go on lengthy multi-session quests to find someone willing and able to cast the correct spell to bring you back can be fun, but after a few times, it can get old.So in order to achieve the former and avoid the latter, it's recommended that you bake the reason for the players coming back from the dead into the story. Death still matters or course, after all the players will have allies (:&lt;If your players aren't too attached to their characters, then who needs plot armor? Let 'em die. If they are, consider some of the options in this section.See:

In order to use a technique, you must spend mana equal to the tier of technique. Cantrips have an effective tier of 0 and do not cost mana. While not in immediate danger (such as combat or a chase), you regenerate 1 mana per turn, or 10 mana per minute.Upcast<br>
By spending more mana, you can increase the effectiveness of abilities with the <a data-href="Upcast" href="techniques/upcast.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Upcast</a> tag. The degree to which varies by ability. Just because you have enough mana in your pool does not mean you can upcast an ability.<br>In order to upcast, you must meet a certain level requirement (see mana basics above) in addition to increasing the mana cost. For example <a data-href="imagination" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">imagination</a> has options up to upcast 5, effectively making that option a level 5 technique, requiring you to be level 9 to use it.Mana Reserves
Mana reserves function exactly like your base mana, except they disappear after used, and only regenerate after you rest. Mana reserves are gained through having positive intelligence, are sometimes given to mage classes and through magic items, often with particular restrictions on their use.Mana Burn<br>
Abilities with the tag <a data-href="Mana Burn" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/status-effects/mana-burn.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mana Burn</a> either reduce your max mana, or have an optional more powerful use case that reduces your max mana. Reduces by 1 unless stated otherwise. Usually goes away on rest. If an ability does not mention a mana cost, then it still reduces current and max mana by 1 if it has the mana burn tag.For clarity: Mana burn does not happen in addition to any mana cost. Mana burn typically serves to weaken a character over an adventuring day, rather than providing an immediate drawback.]]></description><link>core-rules,-how-to-play/abbreviations-and-terminology/mana.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Rules, How to Play/Abbreviations and Terminology/Mana.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:46:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Graze]]></title><description><![CDATA[Graze is an attack that is not a complete miss.

If it's a general party question, or if you bring your lucky friend with you during your shopping trip, they could reasonably roll it instead.Again, if you already had an answer in mind, don't roll this.

Experience is a meta-currency gained through prioritizing primary campaign events that allows players to influence the story/chronological order of things in order to accomplish personal goals quickly and get back into the action faster. As a baseline, 10 XP is the equivalent of one in-game day of events.<br>
Experience is rewarded for spending time working towards campaign goals in an active manner. This mainly means exploring dungeons, splitting heads, and overthrowing governments - anything that is both related to the main campaign objectives, and is not part of downtime events (such as recovering from an <a data-href="Affliction" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/status-effects/affliction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Affliction</a> or <a data-href="Crafting" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Crafting</a>). XP is rewarded based on the time required to complete the mission, with additional bonuses for overcoming particular challenges.
The purpose of XP is to reward taking action. While downtime is an important part of roleplay, it's easy to justify staying in town making safe money or doing side quests to save up for a shiny new weapon or achieve personal goals if there isn't an obvious time constraint on important story events. It's easy to hold off on an important event and try to squeeze a few more days of crafting into your schedule.
Instead, XP serves to reward taking action immediately, without penalizing downtime events like crafting.]]></description><link>core-rules,-how-to-play/abbreviations-and-terminology/xp.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Rules, How to Play/Abbreviations and Terminology/XP.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 16:38:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Technique Point]]></title><description><![CDATA[A technique point gives you access to the next tier of a technique tree equal to the number of points you have invested in it, from 1 to 6.

On a 6 or higher, the players go first, or a 5 or lower, the enemies go first. On the first round of combat, whichever party went first decides which creature acts first. Then you swap to the other party and they decide who goes. You repeat this process until either every creature has acted, or one side has several creatures that haven't acted. All remaining creatures act on the same turn and then you start back from the top, using the same order as round 1.When initiative is rolled, all <a data-href="Buff" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/tags/buff.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Buff</a> effects disappear automatically (unless its duration is longer than 1 minute).

In DnD and its derivatives, if you get the jump on your opponent, the sneaky party gets an entire turn to themselves. This is not the case in Nick Nacks. The conventional "surprise round" is now a normal round in combat.All characters that are surprised lose are DD during the first round, and the surprising party always goes first in initiative. Surprise can be a bit finicky sometimes, making you question if only some characters should be surprised. If that's what your gut tells you, that's how it is.For example, your party's rogue who was hiding in an alley ambushes a group of guardsmen that are harassing the rest of the party. The guard captain notices but his men do not. Captain is not DD, the rest are.What happens when our party starts fighting in the middle of talking?
In the event where there are two parties that don't immediately fight, when initiative starts is usually determined by whenever someone takes an aggressive action, such as casting a spell or drawing an arrow. In these cases, where both parties are aware of each other, initiative gets rolled immediately before any actions happen.Certain types of underhanded tactics can get around this, such as using sleight of hand to draw concealed weapons or deception for a sucker punch. See surprise for more details.]]></description><link>core-rules,-how-to-play/abbreviations-and-terminology/initiative.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Rules, How to Play/Abbreviations and Terminology/Initiative.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 04:25:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[DD]]></title><description><![CDATA["Denied Dodge"

Spontaneous elementals often use their violent magics to spread the presence of their element further from the source, or defend its element from being extinguished.Many elementals will disappear on their own when there is nothing for them to act on.]]></description><link>bestiary/creature-types/elemental.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Bestiary/Creature Types/Elemental.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 05:30:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fire Blast]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tier 3 <a data-href="Pyromancy" href="techniques/spell-techniques/pyromancy/pyromancy.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Pyromancy</a> <a data-href="Spell" href="techniques/spellcasting-rules/spell.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Spell</a><br>

The best example of people being forced into the "game designer" position (who really shouldn't have been) is this well known issue that it wasn't worth casting healing spells in combat because they healed so little compared to incoming damage. Healers, who also have potent offensive magic, would just let people get to zero HP, then resuscitate them right before their turn with the weakest, lowest commitment healing spell so they both at least get to do some damage before the injured person goes down from the next thing that breathes on them. This was called "yo-yo healing" because combat would become a whack-a-mole game of people going down, then up and down again. For some reason, it became really popular to punish going unconscious with debuffs. This is like seeing smoke and trying to fan it away while making the fire underneath worse. Great, now the situation you don't really have the tools to avoid now punishes you further. With such a terrible "fix" being so popular, clearly being a game designer isn't an easy, "anyone can do it" job. It takes years of experience to get good at it. Most people were unable to identify the root cause of "yo-yo healing", which was eventually correctly addressed as low healing output 10 years later by the actual game designers when they buffed healing magic. That being said, the average player, and even modder, likely isn't that great at even identifying WHY something is a problem or why something is causing them to have less fun. After I started playing with KeepInventory, I started feeling dissatisfied after a while of using death as a way to just get back to my spawn. I couldn't just eject the "forbidden knowledge" from my head. What I eventually realised is that I DID want death to have some kind of punishment, I just didn't want it to cause "oh my god, I'm going to lose hours of progress!" kind of panic. The real solution ended up being installing a gravestone mod so I still had to collect my death loot."<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/@floofzykitty5072" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/@floofzykitty5072" target="_self">@floofzykitty5072</a> May 2025]]></description><link>game-design-rambling/random-youtube-comment.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Game Design Rambling/Random YouTube Comment.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 03:16:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Upcast]]></title><description><![CDATA[Many abilities, particularly <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Technique" data-href="Technique" href="techniques/technique.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Techniques</a>, become stronger or gain additional functions as you gain levels.This is formatted as "Upcast X," where X is how many technique levels higher it becomes.

A creature can safely donate up to one less than their maximum. There are usually safeguards against donating your max mana, but less savory individuals don't mind. Spending your max mana gives you the Tier 3 <a data-href="Affliction" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/status-effects/affliction.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Affliction</a> <a data-href="Mana Starvation" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mana Starvation</a>. This means that most common people are only able to donate 1 Mana each day. Children typically do not possess enough mana to safely donate.Specialized facilities and gilded altars are incredibly expensive, typically costing hundreds of thousands of gold to craft. This makes it so facilities for mana donation tend to be rather sparse, only located in sizable settlements with magical and religious influence.<br>When mana is extracted, it is turned into a <a data-href="Mana Crystal" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mana Crystal</a>. Mana Crystals are versatile and can change between states of matter, becoming either liquid or solid for ease of storage. Each point of mana can earn 4g in a mana extraction facility. In a church, it earns 5 GBP and food/lodging for the day.Most religious services happen in the evening after work, so that way people may spend their mana as they wish during the day, and donate it at night if they wish. With large generous populations this can mean that you can amass large quantities of mana rather quickly. Because most people can only donate 1 mana, you can almost 1:1 translate a population of donors to daily mana generation. Not everybody who donates has commoner tier mana, but at the same time, not everybody can always donate! So the 1:1 ratio is generally the go-to method of determining mana generation over time.Again, not all places have the correct facilities, so this is often available in villages.]]></description><link>equipment/economics/mana-donation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Equipment/Economics/Mana Donation.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 01:03:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mana Burn]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mana Burn is the loss of a daily <a data-href="Mana" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/recharging-abilities/mana.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mana</a> slot such that it cannot be recovered until you take a <a data-href="Long Rest" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/hitpoints/long-rest.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Long Rest</a>, and needing to re-prepare the ability to another slot to use it again.

death. Respect for the dead in many cultures comes from experience of what happens when the dead are desecrated, as lynching, mass murders, fires, and other horrific deaths where the death is not properly honored can result in the creation of naturally-occurring undead.Undead created naturally typically have unfinished business, obsessions, or grudges against those that wronged them. They are often lucid of the facts surrounding their demise, and do everything in their power to correct their qualms - after which they must be put to rest.Undead created by outside forces are constantly suffering a cruel fate, forced to live in broken bodies and without a will of their own. Casters that engage in this magic must be wary, as every day that passes runs the risk of letting the latent memories in these spirits manifest into wills of their own with their only desire being to destroy the caster that enslaved them. In the same vein, a caster that respects the wishes of a created undead can use their unfinished desires to their advantage, using alliances over enslavement to form lasting bonds until they are put to rest.]]></description><link>bestiary/creature-types/undead.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Bestiary/Creature Types/Undead.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 05:05:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Extraplanar]]></title><description><![CDATA[An Extraplanar creature is any creature that originates and lives in another plane of existence.

If you get attacked this way, the same creature can't also AoO you for leaving their threatened square in the same turn.]]></description><link>core-rules,-how-to-play/more-rules/size-and-reach.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Rules, How to Play/More Rules/Size and Reach.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 09:47:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Perception]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a data-href="WIS" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/ability-scores/wis.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">WIS</a>-based <a data-href="Skill" href="skills/skill.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Skill</a>.

However, in order to establish some reference for pricing adventuring gear and items, we have to settle on one - so, for the purposes of the default pricing and earnings, we're going forward with the assumption that the differences between the peasants, tradesmen, and aristocrats is large, but not in such a way that compromises the ability of the peasantry to afford basic items.As a fantasy setting with swords and monsters, there are comparisons to be made to the value of labor in the medieval era. However, in order to avoid mixing the complexities of medieval economics with magic and superheroes to an audience that may not have studied such, the gap between the peasants and aristocrats is reduced, and social mobility is substantially increased.

Another benefit of this minting is that it causes gold pieces to naturally stack into specific values (5, 10, 20, 100, 1000). Someone can easily hold 100g in their pockets, or 1000g in a dedicated pouch. Anything more and they are bursting at the seams and would be better off with a bank, or to switch to alternative methods of payment.Carrying around a bag of 100,000g would be like the real-world equivalent of carrying around a several briefcases full of paper currency. While this may happen for large transactions or when hauling away a dragon's horde, it's usually difficult to avoid drawing attention if you were to do it on the regular.When imagining gold costs, use the following:]]></description><link>equipment/economics/the-value-of-gold.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Equipment/Economics/The Value of Gold.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 01:00:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shield]]></title><description><![CDATA[Shields are a subtype <a data-href="Weapon Group" href="equipment/weapon-rules/weapon-group.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Weapon Group</a>.

Unfortunately, many argue that all optional mechanics are neutral tools for difficulty management that do not impact the core gameplay experience. As players and developers, we should focus on creating environments that allow individuals to experience the game in the way they prefer—including doing so without imposing significant changes that undermine the integrity of the core challenge. The goal should be to empower players while respecting both the game’s design and their personal approach to difficulty.In the gaming landscape, the design of difficulty and balance is a necessary part of accessibility for users with handicaps - especially in harder titles. Players that are too old or too new, that have responsibilities that pull them from the game, limited time, or that simply lack the necessary abilities to enjoy a game should have the necessary means to level the playing field.
The design of difficulty in games can be broadly categorized into three distinct approaches: numeric, complexity-based, and opt-in mechanics. Numeric difficulty involves straightforward adjustments such as increasing enemy health, damage output, or resource scarcity, making encounters more difficult through quantifiable means. This is the most simple approach, and is used as part of the other approaches - but alone is often only appropriate for games with minimalist mechanics and low skill expression.
Complexity-based difficulty, on the other hand, will change enemies to act with more intelligence, have more varied abilities and attack patterns, and require players to master the mechanics already present in the game to keep up. This is often the preferred method for any game with strategy or skill expression, but is the most taxing to implement.
Finally, opt-in mechanics—such as summoning allies, flying, or activating other assistive features—allow players to choose whether to bypass or mitigate certain challenges altogether. While these mechanics are often presented as optional tools for difficulty management, their adoption and integration can fundamentally alter the player’s experience. There's a clear outlier here. There are no limits to what developers can put into their games as "optional" mechanics. The flexibility is a double-edged sword, as the implementation can just as easily ruin the experience if there is not an appropriate alternative or less invasive means. For the purposes of this discussion, I will mainly refer to Skyrim, Mario, and Elden Ring.All three methods of designing difficulty can easily interrupt the core gameplay experience when implemented thoughtlessly. In Skyrim, there is very little strategy and skill expression. At best, the player can move out of the range of some enemy attacks and strike back between them, or properly aim an arrow. Beyond that, the game is no different to MMOs such as RuneScape, where the player either engages in a slap fight whose winner is determined entirely by opposing statistics and how much healing is in their inventories, or the player stands out of reach of a melee opponent and attacks them with ranged weapons until they die helplessly.
Skyrim uses numeric difficulty. Despite being the easiest approach, there are major oversights in its implementation that force players to use specific playstyles or exploits to keep up. For example, a player that wants to use primarily destruction magic will be greatly disappointed on higher difficulties as their entire Magicka bar is depleted defeating a single lesser bandit, and the abysmal regeneration rate and lack of potions will force them to resort to sword fighting or the use of AI exploits and loading zones. As the game progresses, the only way to have enough Magicka to defeat enemies without hours of grinding is through Alchemy-Enchanting exploits that bring the cost of spells to 0, or their damage to arbitrarily high numbers—the latter of which completely defeats the purpose of the numeric difficulty increase.Complexity-based difficulty is the hardest to implement. With the exception of complexity through AI improvements, it requires making more content on top of what should already be an adequate amount of content for lower difficulties. The more mechanics an enemy has, the higher the odds that they will invalidate a certain method of playing the game and require players to do something they are not interested in. For example, if the difficulty is in higher enemy aggression, then any playstyle that relies on large openings is going to suffer disproportionately. If the difficulty is in close-range incapacitation, then melee players will suffer more than ranged ones. Sacrificing some part of the original experience is often inevitable.
There are exceptions where the numeric and complexity approaches meet. The speed of a game and the precision of its timings are a good example—Most of the game remains untouched, and a small adjustment in the reaction time necessary to beat the game can be the difficulty a player wants.At the crux of the issue lies difficulty through optional mechanics. These are the most likely to change the experience of a player.
In Elden Ring, the variety of abilities in the game ranges from completely impractical to game-trivializing superpowers. Some are very similar to each other, such as two weapons of the same class with similar movesets that have wildly different performance. Most are not at all similar, making the experience when switching from one to the next completely different. Despite this, one could make an argument that the difficulty in the game rises from which strategies the player chooses.
The most polarizing optional mechanic is Summoning. This changes the game from single player to Co-Op vs AI, or Co-Op and AI vs AI. Using this, a player can use NPC assistants to make enemies ignore the player, or simply ask a friend to beat the game for them while they watch. The extreme nature of this mechanic has caused heated debate in online communities as to what extent an optional mechanic can be used to manage difficulty before it simply becomes thinly veiled cheating.Cheating in most games is simply breaking the rules to your benefit. In the context of early video games, cheating was specifically programmed into games using "cheat codes" that would allow players to break the rules. Later, specialized pieces of hardware such as Action Replay were introduced that are akin to modern hex editors, allowing players to cheat by changing any variable they could find, far beyond what developers willingly included in their games. All of these were widely agreed to be forms of cheating.
And yet, the definition of cheating became more flexible as time passed, even though little changed in what players were capable of.In Super Mario games, there exist powerups that grant the player complete invincibility combined with another powerup that only appear when a player has died in a level multiple times. These are essentially easily accessible god modes that can be used to skip content that is too difficult or boring to play normally, or for any other reason the players see fit.
There is no code that needs to be input. There is no need to go out of one's way to obtain these powerups. They aren't even labeled as cheats. They are even included with explicit intent to be used by a portion of the player base—while many cheats in the past were added just for the sake of having cheats (such as with Big Head Mode) or as rewards for completing the game.
And yet, despite the lack of labeling, there is a subtle acknowledgement that using these is different than beating the game "normally." Achievements and collectibles will look different, scores may be altered, and the game otherwise records your use of these items to give your completion of the game an asterisk.The difference between invincibility powerups and other cheats is that invincibility powerups are deliberate additions intended to help players of lower skill or patience complete the game. They are easy, low-effort inclusions that sacrifice a portion of the gameplay for an easier experience, which would sour the experience for players that do not need them. They are still, however, cheats. They break the rules to your benefit.In Skyrim (PC), the player can, at any time, open the console to manipulate the game via console commands. This is more akin to classic cheat codes, where no player would be able to guess what they need to type into the console to cause a specific effect without looking up the codes, but is closer to the power of hex editors in terms of possibilities.
Skyrim's console blurs the concept of cheating far more than a handicap feature would. Unlike other cheat codes, the use of the console is far more common even among players that do not like cheats for one reason: Skyrim does not function as a game.
Did the player get stuck in random map geometry? The console allows them to teleport out. Did a quest break? The console can skip to the next step. Did the game crash? The console can be used to restore progress without needing to replay content.By definition, these are all instances of cheating, yet many would decline to call it such. Cheating has a harsh connotation that someone is cheapening an experience by breaking the rules, and yet this time the cheats are used specifically to improve the experience of a broken game—and arguably play closer to the rules as intended.How do you know what a developer's intentions are? Intuition is a helpful tool, but it is also often wrong. Unless someone spoke their intentions, there cannot be certainty... But we can still make reasonably educated guesses.In Elden Ring, a common argument in favor of using anything the game offers is that, if it's in the game, it's intended to be used. The developers wouldn't have added it if they didn't intend for players to use it. This is obviously a baseless assertion, and there are plenty of examples where this intuitive reasoning falls short.
Soon after the game's release, there were debates as to whether or not weapons such as Rivers of Blood and summons such as Mimic Tear were so powerful as to be unintended, or even be considered cheating. Players that defended these inclusions used the above argument, only to later find that both of these (and some underlying systems that improved them) were patched to reduce their effectiveness.
Which one was truly the intended way of playing the game? Was it before or after the developers changed it? What else will the developers change? Can developers change their intentions?
Some players that use this argument will make exceptions. For example, some enemies can be coerced into falling off of the map to their deaths, or get stuck such that they are easy targets. These will be exception cases, because their intuition tells them that the developers did not intend for enemies to simply fall off of the map and die on their own.
And yet, despite the developers being able to modify the game however they wish, patches keep going by where these supposedly unintended inclusions remain untouched. When observing the design of the game, it is reasonable to try and guess developer intentions based on conflicting design principles and a charitable interpretation of the intelligence of whoever made it, even without the say of the developers. If in the vast majority of cases a condition is true, except for one specific case where there does not seem to be any reason for the deviation, an argument can be made that the aberration is not intended.
For example, in Elden Ring, there are almost always methods to avoid an instance of damage as a player of reasonable reaction time and positioning. Enemy attack patterns will place the attacks in such a way that that is always the case for their target. However, if there are multiple enemies, an attack may be placed in such a way that it is avoidable for the primary target, but not for any others nearby. This can be considered an unintentional side effect of the optional mechanic of multiplayer.In Minecraft (Java Edition), players frequently modify the game using third party programs to drastically alter the gaming experience in ways far outside of the scope of the original game. It would be reasonable to assume that the intentions of the developer do not take into account anything a player may find in the landscape of unofficial changes to the game. Some of these modifications may be considered cheating, while most are considered changing the game entirely such that it is no longer "truly" Minecraft. However, there are modifications to the game whose only purpose is to improve the performance of the game, allowing more players the ability to play the game at all. Some modifications fix behaviors and perceived oversights to make the game more consistent.Are these third party changes bringing the experience closer to what was intended? The Minecraft speed-running community certainly thinks that some do. Performance-boosting modifications that do not change the basic rules of the game are allowed and encouraged. It's intuitive that the game running better rather than worse is the intention of the developers. Being able to reset the game more quickly or load faster are generally accepted to not be considered in the realm of cheating due to not affecting the integrity of the performance of the player during their speed-run.There it is—Integrity. There is a sort of principled superiority that cheating is playing the game "wrong," and that accomplishments that were only acquired via cheating are illegitimate. This intuitive understanding is highly attractive, as speaking with someone who claims the same accomplishments as yourself while having a different experience reaching that goal will inevitably cause a disconnect. It can invoke feelings of mockery, as if your efforts are being undermined and cheapened by someone with a GameShark. Cheaters that are perceived to lack integrity are seen as dishonest and insincere.It is no surprise that people will be on the lookout for any examples of something that can be seen as cheating. Whenever there are perceived rules and the perceived breaking of said rules, there will be conflict among players. Developers should keep this aspect of human nature in mind when designing their game, especially if they do not put any effort into explaining their intentions to the players. Players are less inclined to fuss about cheating and accomplishments when difficulty and handicaps are properly communicated to them. When numeric and complexity difficulties are clearly labeled "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard" with descriptions of their effects, and opt-in mechanics are properly balanced or labeled as handicaps, players are more likely to be able to have civil discussions about the game's design.At the end of the day, the purpose of games is to have fun. Players will act in accordance with what they find most enjoyable (and accessible), and they will associate with other players that have similar values to their own. Players are also not expected to have the emotional intelligence or logic capacity to put together well-reasoned and compassionate arguments to connect with others that do not think like them. They are expected to complain, pick sides, and attack anyone with opposing views, needlessly causing divides that the developers could have easily avoided.Elden Ring is a gold mine of thoughtless arguments and assumptions from players due to the vague and often half-baked implementation of its core difficulty management mechanics. For this, we will be focusing on the debate around the users of summons against solo/difficulty purists, as both sides suffer from astounding levels of shortsightedness on the subject.Let's start with solo purists that claim that anyone that used summons did not truly "beat the game" and that they "played the game wrong." There are legitimate arguments to be made about the poor implementation and incredible variance in effectiveness from the use of summons. Truly, they can be akin to using a Super Leaf in Mario games to skip entire areas and bosses from the sheer power that having another player or ally in a fight can bring. The way enemies do not take into account the presence of additional enemies for their choice of actions reveals a lack of polish or worse. In some cases, enemy AI will simply cease to function when a creature is defeated, or their movements and bodies will become unnatural as they change targets mid-attack, resulting in deceptive and jarring visuals that do not appear as intended behavior.
However, there is no reason to attack others for choices made for the purposes of entertainment in what may as well be a single-player game. Without the developers defining what it means to beat the game, like in Mario, the player's assertions are baseless.As the player progresses further into the game, many of the enemies have identical gameplay with only minor cosmetic differences—and enormously increased statistics. It is not uncommon for a player to fight a generic soldier with a sword and trade hits to defeat them in one blow, only to find the exact same enemy wearing a different color shirt that can kill the player in a single blow. It is entirely possible for a player to simply not have enough ammunition to defeat even a single enemy from differences in numeric difficulty, resulting in certain playstyles being invalidated via arithmetic impossibility. What would normally be a method of difficulty control instead becomes a burden for the player to level up their character to unreasonable strength, skewing the experience unnecessarily because of arbitrary restrictions from the developers.
Furthermore, the action of increasing one's level has no relation to the core gameplay experience or player skill. If a player wishes to improve their numerical abilities until winning is possible, they will most likely resort to repeatedly resting at a save point and attacking defenseless enemies for an arbitrary amount of time until they have enough points to do so. There is no option to use skill to increase one's ability to deal damage when the resources used to do so are limited - if you have ten shots, and the enemy can survive eleven, no amount of skill will help you win. The increase in "difficulty" using numbers serves no purpose except to waste hours of a player's time when players opt for weaker strategies.Strategies and weapons that are stronger or weaker are often touted as the game's main way of adjusting difficulty. In many cases, these are legitimate, non-invasive methods that do not significantly alter the core gameplay experience. If a player likes a specific kind of weapon or spell, chances are there are alternatives that function similarly enough while being substantially more or less effective. It's always easier to reduce effectiveness, as a player can choose not to upgrade a weapon, but it is not always possible to increase the strength of a playstyle past a certain point. That is the point at which this method of difficulty implementation fails. It is a common argument among users of summons that anyone that complains about numeric difficulty while refusing to use opt-in playstyles is trapped in a cage of their own making. This view isn't just false, it's patronizing and misses the valid portion of the purist argument. Summoning, for example, changes the core experience of the game to such a degree that it can and will lead to questions of integrity and legitimacy in a run. Even inexperienced players identify that someone or something else defeating enemies for them "feels" like it made their own contributions irrelevant (because it did).That all tools the game offers are equally valid means of managing difficulty is an equivocation. To insist others use them in the same way they would an "enemy health and damage multiplier" lacks nuance and borders on dishonesty. To the purists, telling them to "just summon" is no different than telling them to "just play Tetris instead," "just use the Super Leaf," or "have you considered handing the controller to your big brother?" since, to them, it is either an alternative game experience that doesn't interest them, or actively cheapens the experience of the game akin to cheating, even if the developers did not say such. To them, the game simply lacks the means to make their chosen way of playing the right difficulty, and their way of playing the game for entertainment is just as valid as the summoners.This problem also exists in reverse. For example, what if someone wants to play with their friends, but does not want to make the game too easy? There are numeric ways to make yourself weaker, but the core experience is warped. No amount of self-restriction will make up for the fact that enemies in the game are not designed to act differently in the presence of multiple opponents.There is one last drawback of opt-in mechanics as difficulty, especially in Elden Ring: Not all mechanics are even available from the start. If you want to play the game from start to finish with Godfrey's Axe, you are required to either arrange for another player to drop the item for you, or you need to cheat. That's right: there are playstyles that are not even accessible. The game does not have a reasonable method to enjoy items granted only after beating the game. This is not even for balance reasons either, as items like Fire Giant's braid and Godfrey's Axe are incredibly weak weapons compared to similar ones obtainable earlier in the game. Limited items exist that never respawn or force players to waste time collecting rare resources, which needlessly punishes inexperienced or challenge run players that are more likely to fail when using them. Given everything discussed, using cheats for the purposes of enabling the game to be played in a specific way that does not affect the integrity of the core gameplay is something that should be reasonable to most. The issue is not cheating, it's integrity. There should always be methods of controlling difficulty within a given set of rules while respecting those rules, self-imposed or otherwise. If the developers fail to do so, it is perfectly within reason for players to point it out.]]></description><link>game-design-rambling/difficulty-and-integrity.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Game Design Rambling/Difficulty and Integrity.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 19:29:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Potency]]></title><description><![CDATA[Potency is the default <a data-href="DC" href="core-rules,-how-to-play/abbreviations-and-terminology/dc.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DC</a> of abilities used by a creature.<br>

Just like in the real world, math is the basis on which everything exists - change one variable, and the world and the cultures within will look much different. Despite this foundational importance, the math in TTRPGs is often neglected or not taken into consideration during its creation, causing the stories built on it to lack plausibility or the players to engage in degenerate gameplay loops that are better incentivized by the math. We must elevate the standards of game balance and mathematical principles within to ensure a stable play environment with maximal freedom of storytelling.For the purpose of this discussion, I'll mostly be referring to the design of Dungeons and Dragons, but these principles extend to all games, TTRPG or otherwise.Here in the real world, our actions are most often decided by their expected outcomes. People grow the food that produces the most in the local terrain, they wear protection to avoid death, they take the path of least resistance, they outlaw actions that harm others. If the outcomes or goals were different, the actions taken would be different - if stabbing someone was a pleasant experience that extended their lifespan, then the laws around stabbing people would be very different. If we only ate for pleasure, we would grow what tasted the best regardless of climate.&nbsp;This is true down to the very foundations of the universe, where the actions that the atoms and forces of the universe take are decided by simple rules. Light takes the path of least time, mass and energy act towards increased entropy, and other such rules determine how everything else acts.Just like in real life, expected outcomes are what guide us in TTRPGs. If the goal of the player is to live the longest and kill the most things, then the actions they take will be guided by what best gets them to that goal. Because this is based on probability, it becomes a question of simple math to determine the best course of action at a given moment. All else the same, the weapon that does the most damage should be what everybody in the world defaults to. All else the same, the strategy that prevents the most damage taken is the best.&nbsp;Math IS worldbuilding.&nbsp;In real life, we can't fight against monsters and men-at-arms with shuriken and our bare fists. Reality dictates that those actions would likely result in our demise. However, in a game, we often find ourselves roleplaying something that isn't exactly realistic - such as a magician slinging fireballs at ogres. If we want to allow the full range of themes to be represented in a game, we need all of them to be on a fair playing field. There is no purpose to allowing "Unarmed Strike" as an action that accomplishes nothing and gets you killed, after all - but we decide the rules of this universe. We can make "Unarmed Strike" deal substantial damage, or have additional benefits that make their use reasonable. By setting the rules properly, what is feasible changes to match our desires.Whether what you desire is a good thing is a discussion for another day - let's focus on the hows.What players do is a combination of what they desire, and what the game rewards. Developers should set the rules to reward what they want to happen, and not reward what they don't. Ideally, the incentives should match what the players want to do.The incentive structure of a game like DnD usually comes in the form of power. More money and experience means bigger and more magical swords and fireballs, or more hirelings, etcetera. When you want a fair game for players to enjoy various themes and strategies, you must balance the power such that there is not a single overwhelmingly dominant strategy that is easily recognized by players. This is only fair; if you have multiple players, and one is given obviously inferior power, they may experience frustration or disengagement when they notice their impact on the game is insubstantial as a result.Fairness in a system of mathematics is fundamentally a question of mathematics.When the underlying math is neglected, and the rest of the game is built despite it, you will quickly find oddities. If you make "Unarmed Strike" deal 1 damage, and "Longsword" deal between 1 and 8, you should not be surprised when nobody will opt for "Unarmed Strike" under any circumstances. If there is a dominant strategy, and yet you still declare that most of the people in this world fight with fists instead of swords (all else equal), your world becomes less believable. From the math, the rest of the world-building should come naturally and without significant leaps of logic - If you declare something exists in this world, there should be a basis for it, and this basis almost always comes from the math.Balanced systems inherently foster deeper engagement. Players are more likely to invest their time into the mechanics of a game when they believe they will not be held back by deviating from superior strategies. By employing mathematical approaches to skill scaling, damage output, resource allocation, and character progression, players are free to choose options based on thematics, creativity, and their own desires without worrying about doing the math on behalf of the developers to make sure they are being dealt a fair hand.Everything I've stated so far may seem obvious, and even patronizing, but the reality is that most developers do not take this into consideration as much as they should.I'll spare you the fine details and skip to the important math to keep in mind.&nbsp;In DnD, there are listed weapons that are assumed to be available from character creation. If we consider the world in which this takes place, it would be fair to assume that the people in the world would also want to survive encounters when selecting their weaponry, and those weapons are boiled down to sets of numbers and tags to describe them. The most important number to a commoner with no bonuses to anything is the damage number - in a fight, the odds to succeed are highest by simply using the weapon with the highest damage. And yet, a dagger deals 2.5 damage, while a stick deals 3.5. If they use a very big stick, they can even reach 4.5, if they don't mind using both hands. If they spend some more money and actions, they can use two axes for a whopping 7 damage, and this is only with "simple" weapons they may be proficient in.The simple conclusion here is that, all else equal, a commoner's preferred weapon should be a stick, or two axes if they have money to spare. The stick is the most versatile, cheap, and powerful weapon available to them. Even if you take into account the bonuses from stats, a commoner would need maximum dexterity to consider a dagger, even compared to weapons they are not proficient in. In this world, using a dagger is mathematically inferior to every other option for any regular, non-player character.&nbsp;This results in a silly world that only suits the players, without taking into account the rest of the creatures. Why would a knife be a substantially worse weapon than a stick?&nbsp;A goat that attacks a human is likely to kill them in a single attack. How long would a farmer last in such a world?Some classes and builds can easily survive far longer and deal multiple times as much damage as others, often while being better at non-combat activities as well. Why would anyone willingly choose to be the inferior class if the objective is to survive?&nbsp;The expected earnings of a player far outpace the earnings of commoners, as untrained labor is only enough to pay for a gallon of ale or a stay at a poor inn while a single piece of basic equipment can be worth a hundred times as much. Is it really acceptable to put the price on a day of deadly work (such as a mercenary) equal to the price of a dagger, one of the worst items in the game, such that a player could hire dozens of them for every adventure?How long can you ride on a player's goodwill and desire for thematics and roleplay before these poor worldbuilding decisions start to interfere with their fantasy?One of the most insidious phenomena in the world of TTRPGs is the tendency of players to defend poor mathematics and imbalanced mechanics, often born out of a fundamental misunderstanding or intentional ignorance of underlying principles. This defense frequently stems from a place of trust in the developers and an emotional attachment to the game itself, leading players to uphold the perceived authority of the creators."If they wanted it that way, they would have made it that way!""You think they didn't think of that? They clearly left it like that for a reason." "Why don't you do better, then?"When players encounter a system that is hailed as "official," there is a natural inclination to assume that the developers have meticulously crafted every detail, and thus, their choices are unquestionable. Players may erroneously believe that since the developers designed the game, they must have considered every possible variable and outcome, rendering any criticism unwarranted.&nbsp;Players may also propagate the myth of developer infallibility, asserting that they are privy to unique insights that justify design decisions. Such attitudes not only inhibit constructive discourse, but they also diminish the validity of collective player experiences and insights, as an entire community’s lived experiences may be rendered irrelevant in the face of perceived expertise. The belief that there "can’t be a better way" is a common claim that started among video game developers, such as at Riot Games and Nexon, as they frequently cite data they claim exists to justify their actions while refusing to release said data to prove it. The truth is that no such data exists, and modern gaming communities can easily get access to or create superior data from which to make decisions.When confronted with suggestions for rebalance, players often leap to the defense of their cherished mechanics, positing that the developers "must have had a reason" for their choices. This blind and aggressive defense of the systems further perpetuates the cycle of flawed designs, as those advocating for improvement or merely offering their observations are dismissed as "Powergamers," or told that they're just not focusing on what matters, and that roleplay trumps game design.Because the foundation of these defenses is inherently fallacious, they almost always lead to a statement that reveals their lack of engagement with the topic. The most common ones include that the game is made to be changed from table to table, that the suggestions are merely opinions and do not represent the needs of the community, that the opinions of those that are not part of successful gaming companies are inherently worthless, and basic attacks on the character of those criticizing the game (rather than focusing on the criticisms themselves).Most players lack the mathematical literacy necessary to fully grasp the implications of game mechanics at a detailed level. Consequently, when flaws in balance emerge—be they overpowered abilities, inefficient resource distribution, or underwhelming options—players may misinterpret these issues as subjective preferences rather than objective mathematical failings.&nbsp;The most common misinterpretation of the math is that of percentage reductions: Most players do not know that reducing an effect by 100% is far more than twice as good as reducing it by 50%. A common way this ignorance appears is in video games such as League of Legends, Minecraft, and Skyrim, where players will honestly believe that combining a reduction of 50% with another 50% and getting a result of 75% is somehow a "diminished" effect because the total did not reach 100%, when in reality the result is a multiplicative, mathematically accurate, and fair way to represent the effect.Combined with the aforementioned bias towards that which is "official," a majority of the population will convince themselves that their intuitive (incorrect) understanding of the underlying mathematics is also aligned with what the developers think - and, unfortunately, they may be correct.The methods used by the developers of DnD to create the game and the underlying math is transparently dubious. By their own (unwitting) admission, the top-down approaches used by them with a lack of emphasis on mechanics and math, insufficient player testing, and dismissal of community feedback has led to books full of wondrous descriptions of a game that does not accurately match their vision in practice.The examples of such are too numerous to list, but to bring up simultaneous examples that perfectly encapsulate the sheer nescience of the lead developers of DnD, we can look at the playtests of DnD 5.5. During the playtests, the developers made a particularly bizarre public video about the results, falsely claiming that a mechanic that players did not interact with was "mathematically one of the most powerful" when it was the worst on average, dismissing feedback because player scores on individual features were higher than the overall score, and even incorrectly referencing their own changes to their own content.&nbsp;What truly happened behind the scenes to cause such a public statement to be made without any proofreading is unclear. It's up to a given individual to review these actions to decide whether it's negligence, ignorance, or deliberate equivocation. I try taking the most charitable approach by assigning ignorance to what could have just as easily been malice.Game developers must adopt a mathematical mindset in their approach. This includes rigorous playtesting with statistical analyses, iterative balancing, and a commitment to utilizing clear metrics for evaluating the effectiveness and fairness of mechanics while maintaining consistency and logic. Checking published content for faults should not be the burden of the players, especially when the product is advertised as being beginner-friendly. Disparities that can be encountered within a new player's first turn should not be tolerated, let alone upheld as intended design.Players should be involved in the balancing process, and even perceived faults in criticism should be thoroughly investigated to identify the underlying reasons for the criticisms being put forth. When a community is particularly large, there's a high likelihood that there will be individuals that practically design the game in its entirety in their criticisms. To dismiss them is the peak of hubris.&nbsp;When a game's fundamentals and mathematical foundations are made airtight, the content built on them will likewise be untouchable. Under ideal circumstances, even inexperienced players should be able to expand on the content in the game with little worry of diminishing the balance. I hope to one day live in a world where criticisms of game balance and mathematics are truly in the realm of the nitpicking and biased, and that all game discussion becomes that of themes and abstractions.]]></description><link>game-design-rambling/math-and-worldbuilding.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Game Design Rambling/Math and Worldbuilding.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 22:55:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[History]]></title><description><![CDATA[All <a data-href="Knowledge" href="skills/knowledge/knowledge.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Knowledge</a> <a data-href="Skill" href="skills/skill.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Skill</a>s can be used to glean relevant History for their subject matters.

It will be referred to as dX in the content.Action resolution is done by using random chance to represent a range of success in an attempt to reach a target number, combined with a bonus based on your character's build, such as from their ability scores, skills, class features, active buffs, and feats.Content is currently being made with a roll equivalent to counting successes on a d15 die, exploding on any number above 1, success being any roll (including the first). This can be written into rolling simulator websites such as Roll20 to speed things up.The benefit of this method is that anyone can roll any number, unlike other systems where a large enough target number will make the roll impossible.The Short Version: Every point added for or against these rolls is about a 7% difference in power.

Some situations can naturally be neutralized by dropping a cage in the right place, but such conveniences are rare. More often than not, restraining your foe is going to involves rope and cuffs.<a href=".?query=tag:Cuffs" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Cuffs">#Cuffs</a>Grabbing and already-grabbed creature allows you to put cuffs on them.One grab is needed per appendage cuffed. You cannot cuff a creature on your own unless you can grab multiple times per turn, in which case you need another free hand. This provokes AoO.This completely prevents the use of their arms outside of simple item interactions. Cuffs can also be placed on the legs to reduce a creatures speed to 15. Combat maneuvers made against a cuffed creature gain a +10 bonus.Cuffs are difficult to escape, and even harder to break. They typically require outside assistance in order to be removed. Because cuffs are typically made from iron and steel, they can take a significant beating.DC to break (Athletics) or lockpick (Hands) is dependent on the type of material and the lock. A typical forged cuff is DC 40 to break, or 20 to pick.Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty.<br><a href=".?query=tag:Rope" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Rope">#Rope</a>Grabbing and already-grabbed creature allows you to tie them with rope.One grab is needed per appendage tied. You cannot tie up a creature on your own unless you can grab multiple times per turn, in which case you need another free hand. This provokes AoO.Rope is easier to destroy than cuffs, but it is also easier to make the restraint more intense. By grabbing one more time, you can prevent the creature from acting completely.Rope tends to be a good way to bind singular creatures, since anybody with a sharp implement can handily free a bound creature.Rope can be destroyed with an attack from any slashing weapon. Using Athletics or Acrobatics, you can pull the ropes apart, but the DC is determined by the athletics bonus of the creature who bound you (30+their athletics bonus). Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty. This penalty can be ignored with a natural attack suitable for freeing yourself, or a slashing concealed weapon.<br><a href=".?query=tag:Container" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Container">#Container</a>Grabbing and already-grabbed creature allows you to forcefully shove them into an object within reach such as a bag, barrel, or box, so long as they can handily fit in the object.Whether or not they can escape generally depends on the object and the tools the captured creature has on hand. Wooden crates don’t do to well when trying to hold barbarians or crafty characters with crowbars.DC to break (Athletics) is dependent on the type of material. Some objects can be handily dealt with, not requiring a skill check. A knife makes quick work of a bag, and given enough space, hammers break boxes.Creatures that are bound can try to free themselves, but take a -5 penalty.]]></description><link>core-rules,-how-to-play/alternative-win-conditions/restraint.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Rules, How to Play/Alternative Win Conditions/Restraint.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 07:25:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surrender and Morale]]></title><description><![CDATA[During combat there come times when you do not wish to fight, usually when one side is close to victory, but can also happen when creatures are clearly outnumbered or outmatched.How well a surrender feels in a situation usually comes down to a gut feeling, affected by a lot of variables. In order to even consider a surrender to be viable, one or more of the following (or other applicable) conditions should be met…
Numbers advantage
Some other clear advantage, such as terrain, positioning, equipment or a powerful noteworthy ally
Heavily damaged or unconscious allies
Consequences for not surrendering (often death or further prosecution)
Hostages
Whether or not creatures are minions or named characters
A surrender requires clear communication, which may not always be possible given the hectic and spread out nature of battle. Some creatures, particularly mindless ones, will not surrender unless specific circumstances are met. Creatures of animal intelligence can be convinced to surrender if you can speak to animals or have wild empathy etc.Surrender can mean forfeiting weapons, fleeing in fear, begging for mercy or something similar. If not all individuals accept the surrender, then the fight continues until they do.]]></description><link>core-rules,-how-to-play/alternative-win-conditions/surrender-and-morale.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Rules, How to Play/Alternative Win Conditions/Surrender and Morale.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 07:22:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ashen One]]></title><description><![CDATA[In dark souls, certain types of creatures, namely the player character, hold a special place in the world's lore.
