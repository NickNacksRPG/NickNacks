# Mage Slayer

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Arcana Proficiency

The first time you land a melee attack against a creature that is concentrating on a spell each round, they must roll a fortitude save (against your DC) or the spell is dismissed.

You can also make a ranged attack, but the fort save is your DC-4.
