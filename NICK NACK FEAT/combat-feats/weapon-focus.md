# Weapon Focus

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

Choose one: slash, pierce or crush

You can use the default special attacks of these weapon types (cleave/lacerate, lunge/pierce defense, backbreaker/concussive strike) at-will.

You also gain a new one depending on the type you chose, usable 1/combat.

Slash: Great Cleave - Attack all creatures within reach

Pierce: Impale - Creature struck provokes an AoO if they move by the start of your next turn.

Crush: Pulverize - Stagger on hit (fort negates)

The default and newly acquired special attacks also add your level to damage.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you have the unarmed combatant feat, then you can apply the effects of weapon focus (crush) to the special attacks granted by it.
{% endhint %}
