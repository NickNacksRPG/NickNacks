# Fan Club \[companion]

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Level 3, Cha +1

You use your influence and charm to gain a group of people that appreciate you. They are often willing to perform minor tasks for you, stick their neck out for you, but not risk their life for you. They are located in one specific place at first, then they may branch as you gain more levels and influence.

The size of your fan club varies based on your level. You multiply this value by your charisma bonus.

One member of your fan club is your _**biggest fan**_. Your biggest fan is always a minion, other than that, there are no restrictions for what your biggest fan can be. When you gain this feat, you decide their class, race, stats etc. They count as a \[companion] if they travel with you.

Your biggest fan doesn't necessarily need to be a playable race, but those that aren't should be acquired through story related encounters rather than chosen.
