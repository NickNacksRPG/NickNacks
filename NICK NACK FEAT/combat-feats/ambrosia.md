# Ambrosia

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Wis +1

You are gifted a pouch from your deity. At the end of each rest, if the pouch is empty, it is filled with food from your god. The ambrosia can be eaten using the same action as "drink potion (usually swift)" or "administer potion (usually standard)."

It heals (7+2\*lvl) and nourishes as a full meal.
