# Ricochet Toss

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

Whenever you make a thrown weapon attack, the weapon you throw returns back to your hand immediately, allowing you to continuously make attacks with the same weapon(s) in the same turn.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a weapon's special effect requires being on the opponent to function (such as exotic weapons like nets), then you cannot ricochet them.
{% endhint %}

You also ignore the attack penalty from using thrown weapons in their second range increment.
