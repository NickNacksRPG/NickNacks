# Unstoppable

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

* You take no penalty to speed while staggered or frosty. This can reasonably extend to other minor temporary speed debuff abilities that aren't these exact status conditions (such as the speed penalty from the icicle cantrip).
* If knocked down, your speed only decreases by 15.
* If you would be unable to move at all, such as being stunned, entangled or grappled, your speed is instead 5.
