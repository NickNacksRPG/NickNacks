# Bullseye

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

Carefully line up a ranged attack and increase the action required to make it to a FRA. Ignore the -4 penalty for shooting in the second range increment.&#x20;

If your target is in the first increment, instead gain +2 attack.

For effects that don't have range increments, such as spells, you can increase the action to cast to a FRA to gain the +2 bonus to attack.
