# Antagonize

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

You can taunt a creature for one round instead of making them shaken when you demoralize them.

You can also use deception just like you would intimidation in order to achieve this effect. The opponent rolls a will save with a DC of 10+your deception bonus.

You can continue this taunt by spending a swift action each turn, as long as you are still within 30 ft of your target.
