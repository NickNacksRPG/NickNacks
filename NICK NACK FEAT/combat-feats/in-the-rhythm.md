# In the Rhythm

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

The first time you miss an attack each turn, add to 2 to a pool. As an immediate action, you can expend all of this pool to increase the bonus of an attack roll you make.

Problems: Doesn't do anything if you hit, making the payoff iffy unless you have many attacks. But the attack bonus is less significant for dual wielding. Can also be used to have the juggernaut morde q effect, stack on minions, one shot enemy with big attack.
