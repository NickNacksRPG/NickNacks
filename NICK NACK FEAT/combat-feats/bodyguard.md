When an ally is moved out of your natural reach (via its own volition or not), you can move as an instant action so that it is again in your natural reach.

Any movement you take using this feat counts against your movement for this round. If you cannot reach your ally, you can move as close as you can get. You can position yourself in the most advantageous way around your ally, assuming you have the movement.
