# The Wall

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Shield Focus

When you wield 2 shields

* You can use the shield special attacks (shield slam/endure) any number of times per battle.
* Gain a +2 bonus to AC against any enemy you attack with a shield for 1 round.
* Tank up does not cost any movement to activate and it does not reduce your speed, effectively allowing you to always tank up, but still only ever in 1 direction.
