# Lightning Reload

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Rapid Reload

Your hands are a blur while reloading, cranking back crossbows and loading bullets with such incredible dexterity it borders superhuman.

For crossbows, you can spend 1 mana as an instant action. Reloading with your crossbow no longer requires an action for 1 round.

For firearms, you can reload your gun as an instant action by spending 1 mana for each shot.
