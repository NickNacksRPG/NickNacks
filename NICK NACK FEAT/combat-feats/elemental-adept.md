# Elemental Adept

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

Choose an elemental damage type (holy, force, etc). Whenever you deal damage of this type, it ignores resistance. Creatures immune to this damage type are instead treated as resistant.

This is usually represented by something unusual for your element, such as a different color. Black fire, green lightning etc.&#x20;
