# Linebacker

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Maneuver Initiate

* You shove creatures 5 ft farther, or 10 ft if you charge.
* If your foe impacts a solid surface or an object when you shove them, they break it if is of average or lesser toughness.&#x20;
* If you shove a creature into an object or surface, they also take 5 damage (usually crush, adjust as appropriate). If the object or surface is particularly dangerous, like a weapon rack or a glass window, then the damage increases to 10.
* If you shove a creature into another creature, they both take 5 crush damage.
