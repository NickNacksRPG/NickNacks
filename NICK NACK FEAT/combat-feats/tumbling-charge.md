# Tumbling Charge

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

When you charge, you can choose to charge through an enemy, rolling around them or running straight through them. This is \[elusive] against the target of your charge. You can end your charge on the opposite side of the creature instead of ending it when you meet the creature. You must still have the movement to do so.&#x20;

You gain flanking against a creature you tumbling charge for the rest of your turn.
