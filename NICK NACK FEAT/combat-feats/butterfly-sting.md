# Butterfly Sting

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

Whenever you critically strike a creature, you can turn it into a regular hit instead and choose to let the next attack another ally lands against them be an automatic crit, so long as it at least hits them.

There is no bonus effect if the next attack is normally a crit.

If another ally attacks the creature, they automatically consume this effect, and cannot "store it" until a later turn.
