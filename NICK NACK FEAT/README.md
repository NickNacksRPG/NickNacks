# Feat Functionality

Feats are features in progression typically gained at every odd level. They allow your character to get bonuses to specific actions, perform entirely new actions and occasionally get general stat increases. Some feats have prerequisites, such as stat requirements or other feats. You must meet all of the requirements of a feat to take it.

Feats come in a few categories.

<mark style="color:green;">General</mark> - General feats mostly assist with some kind of out of combat task, such as things to increase the consistency of skills.

<mark style="color:green;">Combat</mark> - A combat feat is only useful during combat, or is at least more skewed towards being useful during combat.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Multiclass</mark> - This feat allows you to borrow a feature from another class. Usually such features are secondary features of the class, or are there for flavor.

<mark style="color:green;">Teamwork</mark> - A teamwork feat requires more than one creature to possess in order to function, usually providing some kind of synergistic effect. The wording of these feats often include "all allies," but it only applies to allies with the feat.

<mark style="color:green;">Magic</mark> - Feats that specifically apply to spells.

<mark style="color:green;">MM</mark> - Short for meta magic. A subsection of magic feats that allow you to apply general augments to spells by spending an additional point of mana. Most require intelligence.
