# Light Steps

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Level 3

Light steps requires concentration, and you can start concentrating on this ability as a free action by spending 1 mana.\
As long as you only move during your turn and take no other action, you can walk along any flat continuous surface. This can include things that aren't even otherwise solid such as water or lava. It can also include things such as walls or ceilings.

You can use this ability for only part of your turn to get to a location, but if you attack, cast a spell etc, then you need a surface you would normally be able to stand on or you plummet.
