Perhaps you used to be a light guardian a long time ago, or you dropped out of your training early. You gain the [Light Guardian's](https://app.gitbook.com/s/N6QDh7J4iyEozmJJtVa8/classes-1/light-guardian) Light Binding special attack. You can only use it once per combat. You do not gain any of the other class abilities that enhance it.
