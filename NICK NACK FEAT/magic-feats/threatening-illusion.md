# Threatening Illusion

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

When you create a \[figment] effect that creates a creature (such as imagination), it also threatens and provides flanking as long as creatures have not saved to disbelieve.

As a standard action, or as an AoO, you can have the figment attack a creature. The creature takes d6 per spell level psychic damage (will negates and creature disbelieves illusion).
