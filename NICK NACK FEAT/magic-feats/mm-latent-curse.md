# MM Latent Curse

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Int +0

Your spells with the \[curse] descriptor can also be cast on items. The first creature to activate or put on this item is afflicted with the curse (save negates). If the save is successful, the curse is lifted. For items that aren't activated or worn (such as a rock) the creature must possess the item or at least 1 minute for the curse to take hold.

With curses that allow for a creative uses, the parameters must be set at the time the spell is cast.

{% hint style="info" %}
SPECIAL: You can only curse three items at a time. When a curse afflicts a creature that plays with your protected items, it no longer counts against this total. If you cast another latent curse with 3 already active, you choose which item is no longer cursed.

You have an innate sense when one of your latent curse spells is triggered.
