# MM Focused Blast

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Int +1

When you cast a spell that deals damage and targets multiple creatures, choose a "primary target." The DC of the spell for that creature is 2 higher. If the spell allows attacks against multiple creatures (such as [Gloom Bolt](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/necromancy/level-2/gloom-bolt)), you also get a +2 bonus to attack against this creature.
