When you cast a single target spell with the \[buff] tag, you can cast it on a companion creature and yourself, or all of your companion creatures (provided they are in range and valid targets). This functions even if the spell has a target of self.

If the spell does not have a listed range, its range for determining when you can buff your companions is reach.
