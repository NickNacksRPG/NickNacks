# MM Residual Damage

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Int +2

When you cast a spell that deals damage that doesn't already have a damage over time effect, add one. The creature takes your CL in damage at the end of its turn for 1 turn if it fails its save. The type of damage matches the damage of the spell.
