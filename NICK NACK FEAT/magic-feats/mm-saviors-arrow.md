# MM Saviors Arrow

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Int +1

You can fire the effect of a spell with the \[healing] tag using the range of a ranged weapon. If the healing spell can target multiple creatures, you can make as many attacks as you like, but cannot target an ally more than once.

You can also choose to target a space to be the origin point of your spell.

As part of using this feat, you can swap to a ranged weapon, then swap back to your staff.
