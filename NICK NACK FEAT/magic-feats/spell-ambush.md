# Spell Ambush

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - Stealth Proficiency

Your spell DC is 2 higher against creatures you successfully hide from using stealth (aka if they would normally be DD from hiding). This only applies to the spell's initial save.

This does not apply to other ways to cause a target to be DD, such as blinding them or feinting.
