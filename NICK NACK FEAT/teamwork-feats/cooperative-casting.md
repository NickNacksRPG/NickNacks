<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - The ability to cast spells

You can use the aid action on an ally within 30 ft to increase the CL ally by 2 for 1 round. When you do this, you can also spend 1 mana to decrease the mana cost of their next spell by 1.

If your level is higher than the creature you are assisting, the CL boost increases to 3.
