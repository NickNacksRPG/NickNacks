# Lead by Example

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

Whenever you perform a skill check you are proficient in, such as sneaking past someone or swimming across a raging river, anybody that follows your lead on their next turn gets a +10 bonus to the same check.

If the task requires more than one turn for you to perform, your allies still get the bonus. If you fail the skill check, your allies do not get the bonus.
