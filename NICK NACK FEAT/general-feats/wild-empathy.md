# Wild Empathy

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> -&#x20;

Gain proficiency in persuasion, but only for use against beasts. If you are already proficient in persuasion, gain a +2 bonus when using it against beasts. Base DC is 10+(creatures level). Add +2 to DC for things like the following: protecting young, is only beast adjacent (magic cow), abused by humanoids, starving, unfamiliar environment, mating season etc.

Succeeding on a wild empathy check makes the creature friendly to you temporarily, allowing you to make simple requests. Beasts are dumb so their help is limited (which one of these guys hurt you, lead me to x). The most obvious use case is to inquire about strange things in the nearby area that have happened recently. Interacting with the same animal over time can give you bonuses or cause you to not need to make a check anymore.
