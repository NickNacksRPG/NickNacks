# Photographic Memory

<mark style="color:green;">Requirements</mark> - +2 Int

By spending a memory slot as a free action, you can memorize everything you are currently looking at, as though taking a photo. When looking back at this memory, you can comb it for further details, such as reading text or inspecting faces in a crowd.

You can only memorize one such scene at a time.
