# Afflictions

Certain monster abilities, as well as the defeated condition, give permanent debuffs to characters. These debuffs represent physical/mental wear and tear beyond the catch-all of hp. The longer you are away from home, the more debuffs you are likely going to accrue.

Debuffs universally MUST have some finite method of curing them. Many of them can be cured just by taking a day off: Spend a night at the local bar or brothel, spend time with family, visit a theme park etc. Others require something more specific. Debuffs come in tiers, the higher the tier, the greater the debuff.

In the heat of combat, you do not gain the afflictions. Afflictions are accumulated after combat. Roll separately for each time you were defeated in combat.

<mark style="color:green;">How do you decide what tier you get?</mark>

Roll a luck check.&#x20;

If you roll below 1, you get a Tier 3 affliction.\
If you roll below 6, you get a Tier 2 affliction.\
Anything 6 or above and you get a T1 affliction

The luck check gets a penalty to the roll equal to afflictions all added up.\
Tier 1 give a -1 penalty, Tier 2 gives -2 and T3 gives a -3 penalty.
