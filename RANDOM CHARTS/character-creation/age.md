# Age

Roll a d100. The result you get is the percentage of the way through your life essentially. Multiply this value by the average lifespan of your chosen race.

70\*.75=52 years old

Most races tend to be children for the first 20% or so of their life, so you can opt to be older if you donâ€™t feel like being a kid.
