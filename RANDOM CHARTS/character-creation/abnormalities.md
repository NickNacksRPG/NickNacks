# Abnormalities

Another feature that can help you decide if your character is a weirdo or not. If you want a relatively average character, don’t roll this.

Roll a d20, then roll a d3. The d20 represents what feature is in question and the d3 represents whether the abnormality tends towards being positive (1) unusual (2) or negative (3). You can roll a few times to decide a few unusual features, decide you want a specific number of each feature, then roll a few d20s, or not roll at all.

Depending on the race, some of the features described as weird or negative may actually be positive or completely normal. Some features may be completely absent from your race. An easy way to create a new negative feature is to completely remove or damage certain features (one eye).

Feel free to go down the whole list if you're a mad lad (though the ladies might not appreciate some of the hair options)
