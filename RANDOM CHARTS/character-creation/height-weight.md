# Height/Weight

Roll a d20 and then flip a coin. The d20 represents the variance as a percentage and the coin flip decides up (heads) or down (tails).

<mark style="color:green;">Example</mark> - Human are average 5'6 and weigh 150. I roll a 10 and get heads.

66\*1.1=72 in or 6 ft, 150\*1.1=165 lbs

If you roll a 1 or a 20, you can choose to be ludicrously tall or smol.
