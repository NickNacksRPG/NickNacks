# Environmental Hazards

What happens when you fall in lava? What does altitude sickness do? Extreme heat? Geysers?

There are all kinds of things that aren't exactly creatures. It would be a tragedy if you had to figure out what happens yourself. This section is filled with all kinds of things that can pose a threat to the squishy humanoids ill prepared for what mother earth has in store for them.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Many creatures you encounter will be adapted to the environment they are in. You should probably not bother having lava affect creatures that are made of fire or obsidian for instance. These are soft immunities that are not included in the creature's stat block and should be granted based on vibes.
