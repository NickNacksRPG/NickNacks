<mark style="color:red;">**Real Deal**</mark> - While copying a creature, gain +2 attack against it.

<mark style="color:red;">**Copy: I'll have what she's having (Su)**</mark> - As a swift action, a shadow can use it's copy ability to create a fully functional handheld object it can see within 30 ft. If the object is magical, it loses its magical properties. If the copied object gets more than 100 ft from the original, it disappears. Using copy in this way does not stun the shadow.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Don't Tread on Me**</mark> - Shadows are just that, shadows. Anything it copies is merely a projection. As such, it does not like it when objects interact with the shadow of its projection. It avoids people stepping on it, creatures walking over it etc. If the shadow's shadow is targeted directly, or included in an AoE effect, its DRA is ignored.&#x20;

If you target a shadow with a piercing melee weapon, you can embed it in the surface and entangle the shadow on hit or with a successful poise break, replacing all other effects and losing access to the weapon. Projectiles like arrows require 3 hits. Shadows cannot remove the entangling items on their own.

## <mark style="color:yellow;background-color:yellow;">Other Traits</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Ability Scores - Str +3, Dex +2, Lucc +0, Int +0, Wis +0, Cha +0**</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Copy (Su) \[poly, true]**</mark> - As a FRA, a shadow can emit a very bright flash of light while gazing upon a specific creature within 30 ft. When it does so It adds this creature to its memory. It can choose to immediately transform into this creature as part of this action. The replication process is almost perfect, giving the shadow access to the creatures memories, skill proficiencies, personality traits, current clothing, appearance, size etc.&#x20;

The shadow gains all of the racial features of the creature it copies (assuming a player character) or all of the natural attacks (including multi attack options)/movement abilities if it is not. A shadow can "memorize" copies of 4 different creatures/objects (see offense traits). It can transform into one as a standard action, or revert to its true form as a free action.

When copying a creature, treat its disguise roll as 26.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Speed**</mark> - Speed(s) of copied creature. It can choose to enter a hybrid form, foiling its disguise, in order to move at a speed of 40, or climb 40.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Feats**</mark> - [Unarmed Combatant](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/combat-feats/unarmed-combatant), [Bonded Mind](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/teamwork-feats/bonded-mind-su), [Feint Partner](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/teamwork-feats/feint-partner)
