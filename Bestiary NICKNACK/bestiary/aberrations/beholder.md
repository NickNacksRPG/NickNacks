<mark style="color:red;">**Gaze (Su)**</mark> - A beholder has many eyes, but one particularly large one it uses to cancel out magical effects. At the start of the beholder's turn, it decides to focus it's gaze on a single creature it can see (free action). The creature is siphoned for 1 round (will negates). It cannot use its eye stalks ability against this target for 1 round.

<mark style="color:red;">**Eyestalks (Su)**</mark> - The beholder's extra eyes have the ability to unleash devastating laser beams at creatures within 100 ft. As a standard action it can shoot three of these laser beams at three different creatures. The effect is rolled randomly (reroll duplicates), more details below.\
\
Outside of combat, the beholders are able to exert more fine control over its eye stalks, allowing it to telekinetically move objects and disintegrate holes into things with ease. Feel free to change up a few eye beams to make your beholders extra special.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Boss Mechanics**</mark> - Whenever a beholder is staggered, instead of its usual effects, it can can only shoot 2 eyestalks on its turn. When it is dazed, instead it can only shoot 1 eyestalk. When it is stunned, its eyestalk ability is disabled, but it can otherwise act normally.

When a beholder is siphoned, instead of its usual effects, its primary eye closes and it cannot use its gaze.

Whenever a beholder is blinded, instead of gaining the blinded condition, its eyestalk DC decreases by 2. Blurred vision is instead converted into -1 to its eyestalk DC.
