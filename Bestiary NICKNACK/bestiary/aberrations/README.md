# Aberrations

Terrors born from the unknowable and the otherworldly. They cannot be reasoned with or rationalized and are utterly insurmountable nightmare that humanity has no hope of escaping.

From the darkest depths of space, the ocean and other mysterious realms, aberrations are often alien creatures uninterested in the conventions of traditional life. Others are strange mixes of the organic and inorganic in unfamiliar animalistic shapes.
