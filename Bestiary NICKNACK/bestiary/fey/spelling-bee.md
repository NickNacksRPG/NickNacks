<mark style="color:red;">**Quiz!**</mark> - As a swift action, quiz a creature within 30 ft on the spelling of a particular word. Spelling bees usually start off with simpler words then move on to more complicated words, unless things look particularly dire. A player can choose to spell it out OR have their character roll linguistics (nat 20 always succeeds).\
<mark style="color:orange;">"Easy"     DC 14</mark> - Thoughtful, influential, equipment, syndrome, claimant, intuitively\
<mark style="color:orange;">Medium DC 20</mark> - Eusociality, splendiferous, separate, etymology\
<mark style="color:orange;">Hard       DC 26</mark> - Platitudinous, antennae, silhouette, acquiesce\
Incorrect responses or cheaters cause the spelling bees swarm to home in on the creature, dealing 10 pierce damage and staggering them for 1 round (fort negates stagger).\
If multiple spelling bees are present, they give one the floor and don't interrupt with their own questions if one has already been asked this round.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Student Becomes Master**</mark> - When quizzed, creatures trained in linguistics can make an opposed roll as an immediate action to trip up the spelling bee and have her own swarm sting her. She is immune to the poison however.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Mix and Match**</mark> - Spelling bees love to combine bees with other creatures. By bringing a creature back to their hive, they can transform them to get a new yellow and black coat of paint. For bestiary creatures, this can result in interesting fusions like the [Bee Rex](../beasts/bee-rex.md).&#x20;

If a player offers to be part of the bee's experiments, they can choose to undergo a 1 week transformation. Over this week they transform to more closely resemble a bee with additional limbs, black and yellow fuzzyness and antennae. They also get one of the following boons and banes....\
<mark style="color:purple;">Boons</mark> - \
1 - You can produce honey. You can produce a few ounces of honey each day, as long as you are not going hungry and have a steady supply of flowers. This honey takes about an hour of work and 24 hours of waiting for the moisture to evaporate to be ready for consumption.\
2 - You get functional wings, giving you the glide quality.\
3 - You get functional antennae, giving you scent 5 ft.\
4 - You get a stinger attack with d8 base damage that applies venom on hit.

<mark style="color:purple;">Banes</mark> - \
1 - You become an herbivore, only able to eat sweet foods like fruit/honey as well as nectar/pollen.\
2 - You become a little too fuzzy, making you better adapted for cold climates. In warm climates you are persistently drained 1 without some cooling method.\
3 - You are protective of your kin. You cannot harm bees unless they attack you first. The first time one of your allies is defeated in combat, you are taunted by the creature that defeated them.\
4 - Your additional bee limbs throw you off balance. You take a -2 penalty to all dexterity based checks.&#x20;
