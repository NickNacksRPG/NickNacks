<mark style="color:red;">**Next Turn Shipping \[companion] \[teleportation]**</mark> - The Boom Reaver has a special rune engraved on one of its hands that gives it direct access to factories used to create contructs. As a free action, as long as it does not already have 2 companions, it can mark a point on the ground for a construct of up to level 3 to teleport to that position at the start of the Boom Reaver's next turn. When the creature appears, all creatures within 10 ft take 20 poise damage. If this poise breaks, knock down.

<mark style="color:orange;">Kinetic Reverberation</mark> - When the Boom Reaver takes slash, pierce, crush damage, it can store the kinetic energy from the blow and immediately release back on their attacker if they are within 30 ft. The attacker takes poise damage equal to the damage dealt to the Boom Reaver. If this breaks their poise, they are shoved directly away from the Boom Reaver 20 ft.
