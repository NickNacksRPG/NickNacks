<mark style="color:red;">**Grapple**</mark>  +11 (+4 MI, +2 charge)\

<mark style="color:red;">**Innate Techniques**</mark> - [Sprint](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/pupper/level-1/sprint)

<mark style="color:red;">**Powerful Charge**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**Tongue Action**</mark> - While grappled by a blessed, the creature's mouth is also busy. They are also silenced.

<mark style="color:red;">**Share the Love**</mark> - Whenever a blessed maintains a grapple or services a creature, they inflict a T3 affliction (will negates).

<mark style="color:orange;">The Master's blessing</mark> - Creature experiences the aches and pains of the world much more vividly as their bones grind against each other and each breath too warm, too cold or too wet. They gain weakness 2 to all damage.

During this time they will be visited in the night by The Master. Without some form of outside assistance to protect their mind from dream intruders, they must roll a DC 24 will save or be unable to resist the temptations of this silent dream visitor and partake of her flesh. Interacting with The Master temporarily abates the pain, and the debilitating status of this affliction, for 24 hours.

After passing the save, the creature can choose to ignore the master on their own without assistance. But if the creature cannot resist for 3 nights in a row, they are unable to resist at all on their own and begin to rapidly transform into a Blessing over the next 3 days.

<mark style="color:orange;">Cure</mark> - Only by meeting with and resisting the temptation of The Master can the affliction begin to fade. Slowly your body acclimates back to your painful existence. After 1 week of standard downtime resting activities, and avoiding all temptations of the flesh, the affliction is removed. A creature cannot receive this affliction more than once.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Service**</mark> - Those blessed by _The Master_ exist to serve. If a creature presents an erogenous zone to the blessed, they will spend their entire turn moving towards that creature and clamor to appease them. Said creature is exposed to the Master's blessing feature. If the creature rejects the blessing (aka passes the save), then that particular blessed ignores further presentations
