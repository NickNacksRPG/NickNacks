<mark style="color:red;">**Innate Techniques**</mark> - 1/day - [Asphyxiate](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/necromancy/level-3/asphyxiate)

<mark style="color:red;">**Grasp of the Undying**</mark> - Any creature grappled by a life drinker or its hands takes 10 necrotic damage and is bone chilled for 1 turn. Can also be done as a maintain option.

<mark style="color:red;">**Handy (Su)**</mark> - A life drainer is surrounded by the spectral hands of the dead, and can command them to grapple their enemies with a +10 bonus (applying effects of maneuver initiate and master as normal).&#x20;

* Creatures that end their turn within reach of a life drainer are automatically subject to a grapple.&#x20;
* A Life drainer can summon a hand that immediately grapples a creature as a swift action.
* When a life drinker dies, a hand spawns in its space and adjacent to its killer, and both immediately attempt to grapple a creature

The hands act autonomously and do not impede the movement of the life drinker. They threaten, cannot move and act on the life drinkers turn. A hand cannot be killed, but by making a shove or drag attack it can be shoved back into or pulled out of the ground automatically, causing them to disappear.

<mark style="color:red;">**Vampiric Touch**</mark> - Instead of a traditional attack, a life drinker drains the life from its foes with melee touches, dealing necrotic damage and healing equal to damage dealt.

<mark style="color:red;">**Grasp of the Starved \[recharge]**</mark> - Target a point within 30 ft. Make a grapple attack with a +14 bonus against all enemies within 10 ft of that point as numerous hands reach to grab them. Any creature grappled has a hand linger to maintain it while the rest recede.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Retrieve \[concentration]**</mark> - A life drinker can use its hands to remotely interact with objects it can see, even retrieving them and appearing back next to it. Doing anything other than grappling requires a standard action each round to concentrate on the actions of the hands.
