<mark style="color:red;">**Sticky Situation**</mark> - A string shot spider is capable of using its spinneret as a projectile weapon. The strings are coated in powerful digestive enzymes that evaporate quickly. When they land a string shot, the creature is clumsy 1 as the web sticks to them and the surrounding terrain. At the start of each turn they are clumsy from this, they take an additional 2d6 (7) poison damage. The web can be carefully detached as a swift action automatically.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Miracle of Life**</mark> - String shot spiders try to capture some of their prey alive. They attach them to the walls and cover them in webs to lay their eggs inside of their skin. Such creatures are still alive, barely, but are unable to rest or recover from the defeated condition. Within a few days, the eggs are ready to hatch and they eat their way out of their host, forming a insect swarm, but it is large and has half as much hp.

In the days leading up to the eggs hatching, a very skilled doctor can roll a DC 30 medicine check to carefully remove the eggs without killing the host. They are drained 3 and require days of bed rest before they can fully recover.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Nest Disturbed**</mark> - Spiders create intricate webs, and the string spider is no different. They cover most surfaces in their chosen home with webs. While in contact with one of these webs, they can tell when a non-spider creature moves into a webbed area, as though using tremorsense.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Web Walker**</mark> - Spiders ignore the difficult terrain of web, and cannot be entangled by webs.
