<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Blindsense</mark></summary>

This creature has extraordinary senses that allows it to sense the presence of creatures without sight.  A creature with blind sense has +4 bonus on perception against a creature to which its blindsense applies. The creature automatically receives a perception check with no penalty when a creature enters this range, even while naturally asleep, and automatically wakes up if it senses something.

A successful perception check indicates the creature has "locked on" and identified the space the creature is in. They gain seeking against any creature "locked on." Once a creature with blind sense has "locked on" to a creature, it stays detected until it leaves the creature's blindsense range, or the creatures blind sense is disabled.

A creature with blind sense can use the "detect hidden presence" feature of perception as a free action once per turn, but only the affecting the range of its blind sense.

Blind sense relies on a specific sense (mentioned in the ability), usually hearing or scent, but can also include things like detecting life (with undead creatures), or feeling tremors in the ground/water.  Blind sense can circumstantially be negated, based on the source.

<mark style="color:green;">Echolocation</mark> - Sound based. A creature that takes sonic damage has their echolocation disabled for one round.

<mark style="color:green;">Lifesense (Su)</mark> - Functions against living creatures. Undead, constructs (and other similar not really alive) creatures cannot be detected with life sense.

<mark style="color:green;">Scent</mark> - Uses a creature sense of smell. Aquatic creatures can only use this underwater. Amphibious creatures can use it in water or land. If you have an item with a creatures scent on it, you get a +2 bonus on survival checks to track them. Scents can be remembered similarly to how you can recognize someone's voice. Creatures with scent automatically get a perception check (vs disguise) against someone impersonating a creature they are very close to.

A creature that is sickened cannot use scent.

<mark style="color:green;">Tremorsense</mark> - Vibration based. Aquatic creatures can use this underwater. Amphibious creatures can use it in water or land. Only functions if the creature (and any creatures it is attempting to detect) is in direct contact with a physical surface.

A creature that is clumsy cannot use tremorsense.

<mark style="color:green;">Thought Sense (Su)</mark> - Functions against intelligent creatures. Mindless creatures cannot be detected with thought sense. A creature that is shaken cannot use thought sense.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Sightless Blind Sense</mark> - In the absence of sight, blindsense is enhanced. The usual methods for preventing blindsense (sickened with super scent) from functioning impose partial concealment on all creatures that their blindsense cannot negate until the condition is removed.

Creatures with sightless blindsense instead get a +8 bonus to perception when blindsense applies and its range is usually higher.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Compression</mark></summary>

You are able to move through spaces designed for creatures 1 size smaller than you without treating it as difficult terrain. You are able to move through spaces designed for creatures 2 sizes smaller than you by treating it as difficult terrain

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Camouflage</mark></summary>

Creature can use stealth to hide without cover or concealment. Cannot be used while being directly observed.

May come with other conditions for use.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Hide in Plain Sight</mark></summary>

Creature has the ability to successfully hide from creatures while standing perfectly still by pretending to be an inanimate object or changing colors. If the creature is already being observed, or enemies have already been surprised by the creature using this ability recently, then it does not function.

Typically creatures do not get a check to see a creature that is hiding in plain sight until they go out of their way to inspect the nearby area, or the hiding creature acts.

The DC to detect them is based on their offense trait DC rather than stealth, but functions similarly when used to surprise attack. If creature has stealth, they can choose to roll it as normal to ambush.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Movement Types</mark></summary>

<mark style="color:green;">Burrow</mark> - A creature with a burrow speed can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock, unless the descriptive text says otherwise. Creatures leaves a temporary trail behind, unless measures are taken to maintain the hole. You cannot charge while burrowing. Starting to burrow underground requires a swift action and provokes an AoO as though moving out of a threatened space.

<mark style="color:green;">Climb</mark> - A creature with a climb speed can easily ascend or descend trees, walls buildings etc, provided there are ample places to place hands, feet etc. Creatures with climb speeds can even climb things without ample handholds using creative methods or exceptional biology in some cases (gecko, snake wrapping around).

<mark style="color:green;">Flight</mark> - You can use a fly speed to move directly up into the air. Any movement moving up at greater than a 45 degree angle is considered difficult terrain. Taking flight requires a swift action that provokes attacks of opportunity as though moving out of a threatened space.

Whenever you take damage while flying, gain clumsy 1. You cannot ascend while clumsy.

Creatures with flight automatically also have glide.

While a creatures speed is reduced to zero, it cannot fly, and plummets.

<mark style="color:green;">Glide</mark> - While not movement impaired, take no fall damage. Reduce any fall damage to minimum value. When falling, move horizontally 5 feet per 1 foot fallen at a speed of 60.

<mark style="color:green;">Hover</mark> - A lesser form of flight, or perhaps something supernatural like telekinesis. Functions as a land speed, but you float around a foot above the ground, allows you to ignore small changes in terrain.&#x20;

Some creatures can use hover to fly during their turn, but they must end their movement hovering over flat-ish ground. You cannot use hover to temporarily fly while clumsy. While clumsy, your hover speed is reduced by 15.

<mark style="color:green;">Swim</mark> - Creatures with a swim speed take no penalties to fighting underwater. Most creatures with a swim speed are either aquatic or amphibious.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Polymorph (Su)</mark></summary>

\[Poly]

Allows a creature to turn into a different creature.  The description of the ability will include the features that it gains when it does so (based off of the features of the shapeshifter class).  If there are no listed features then assumes that it gains none.  While polymorphed a creature is unable to use any of the abilities based on its physical form, such as its natural attacks or poison, if they originate from their original form.

Descriptions typically use features from the shapeshifter class.

Ex

<mark style="color:yellow;">Polymorph: Humanoid (Su) \[poly, true]</mark> - Any medium or small humanoid

<mark style="color:yellow;">Polymorph: Beast, Dog (Su) \[poly, true]</mark> - Attack (bite), Manhandle (topple)
