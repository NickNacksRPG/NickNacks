Many creatures are susceptible to specific forms of attack. This is represented by a numerical value that increases damage taken. Common examples include elemental damage, such as frosty creatures being weak to fire. Whenever a creature takes a listed type of damage that it is weak to, increase the damage by the list of amount.

Ex. Weakness 5 (fire)\
A 10 damage fire sword swing would deal 15 dmg instead.&#x20;
