# Boss Creatures

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="109"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>[Boss]</td><td>These creatures are distinct in that they command a certain degree of authority or power. Bosses are not always unique enemies, but there is a overlap. Bosses have significant boosts to their action economy. They get a handful of other bonuses as well.</td></tr><tr><td>Monster Lore</td><td>As part of a successful monster lore check, a character also learns any special mechanics of a boss creature, something more involved to defeat it. Think like a video game boss fight where you need to break its armor before you can get to the weak spot.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <mark style="color:green;">Bonuses</mark>

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="138"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recovery</td><td>At the start of a boss's turn, if it is still suffering from an effect from status that affected it last turn, it gets a new save against the effect.<br>The intention is to stop stun-lock from a single effect.</td></tr><tr><td>Boss Actions</td><td>The boss can act out of turn in response to specific events, usually at the end of a player's (or their allies') turns. These actions should typically be low impact compared to its main turn, doing things like creating disruptive terrain, summoning minions etc.<br>The intention is to make the boss feel a little bit more dynamic, like it's responding to the player's actions and acting accordingly. Try to avoid adding too much mobility or risk having this be an easy escape.</td></tr><tr><td>Poise Resistance</td><td>Boss creatures sometimes have resistance to poise damage.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <mark style="color:green;">Types of Boss Actions</mark>

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="116"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wind Up</td><td>Wind up abilities all have a major indicator that lets the players know that something dangerous is about to happen. A boss charges up its laser, the ground quakes in an area, a burly boss lifts a titanic object etc.</td></tr></tbody></table>
