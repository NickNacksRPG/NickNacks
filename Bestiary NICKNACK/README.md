# Bestiary Basics

The bestiary is separated into 3 main groups: Monster qualities, the monsters themselves and environmental hazards. Monster qualities are not always exclusive to monsters, but they are much more common on them. Many qualities that appear frequently are not described in bestiary entries and are instead described here in order to save time/space.&#x20;
