When not under duress, you can take 10 on skill checks. You normally cannot take 10 on opposed skill checks. Good for profession and general crafting.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Taking 20</mark></summary>

When not under duress, and with a lot of time on your hands, you can automatically achieve the result of rolling a 20. It takes 20 times as long as the task would normally take. It is also assumed that during this time, you fail several times, making it ill-suited for a situations where there are consequences on a fail (such as smashing a wall or deactivating an explosive).

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Group Skill Checks</mark></summary>

In certain circumstances, creatures may want to work together perform the same task. If it is something that can tangibly benefit from group effort (pushing over a large boulder, creating a spell etc.), use the bonus of the creature with the highest modifier, then get +1 for each assisting creature and +2 for each assistant creature that is proficient in the task at hand.

In other circumstances, you may want to use skills as a group when you need to, even if it less than optimal, such as group stealth with a clumsy heavy armor user. In such scenarios, you use the bonus of the weakest link as though everybody were assisting them.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Gambits</mark></summary>

Using a rule system inherently poses limitations on the actions that a player can take. The idea of gambits is to let players take their cool ideas and let them play out despite the games mechanics. If your player wants to do something that isn't necessarily covered by the rules (or only vaguely), then it counts as a gambit.

The intention behind gambits is to create situations that have incredibly high risk and high reward. Before performing a gambit, the player tosses out a few ideas on how they plan to perform the action and the GM makes suggestions and/or adjustments based on circumstance. The GM should make it clear to the player what their roundabout odds are for completing a given gambit.

Benefits for performing a gambit can include things like not taking fall damage with a plunging attack, gaining extra movement by swinging on things through danger or surviving otherwise deadly circumstances.

Drawbacks for failing when attempting a gambit can include things like being CC'd, losing poise, losing hp or having their actions interrupted and made impossible. In extreme cases if players do something very silly, like jumping up cliffs or battling forces of nature, they may accumulate afflictions, or other long lasting debuffs.
