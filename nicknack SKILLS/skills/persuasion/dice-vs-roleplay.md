# Dice vs Roleplay

Persuasion is one of those skills where you can reasonably skip past lots of dialogue in order to get the desired result more quickly and efficiently. _However,_ this is a role-playing game. So regardless of how big someones persuasion bonus is, no matter the suggestion, you must persuade something someone could conceivably be willing to do on their own, in the right circumstances.

On the opposite end, even if you do not possess the persuasion skill, you might still be able to convince an NPC of something if you present the right information in the right circumstances. A gruff pirate might not be interested in a -1 cha fighter, but if he says he knows where treasure is the pirate has been hunting for decades, that can change his mind.

Role-play and dice are 2 different tools to acquire the same result, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Neither should be dismissed as nonviable and one should not be required in order to succeed at the other.
