<details>

<summary>Assess the Wounded</summary>

A creature that is wounded can be examined to determine how they were injured, how long ago it happened and whether they are in grave danger of dying. This also functions on corpses. The more complex the ailment and the longer the duration since it happened, the higher the DC. Duration may reverse in scaling in the case of diseases, where more time passing makes the symptoms more obvious.

<details>

<summary>Provide First Aid (P)</summary>

As a standard action you can cure creatures of status ailments to a creature within reach. You can remove sickened stacks, bleed and blurred vision. The DC of removing any of these conditions is the DC of the ability that inflicted them. If they have no DC, then assume the class/offense trait DC. When you succeed in providing first aid to heal a condition, the creature heals 1 HP.

Performing first aid without a first aid kit imposes a -5 penalty.

<summary>Long Term Care (P)</summary>

Resting under the care of a creature that is proficient in medicine lets you recover 1 drain every 3 days instead of every week. You also qualify for removing many types of afflictions, both physical and mental.

<summary>Prevent Recovery (P)</summary>

If you have defeated creatures in your custody that you don't want to be waking up at inconvenient times, you can choose to treat them so that way they do not naturally recover hp (including regen and FH). This requires a few minutes to perform, and lasts 24 hours.

<summary>Identify Affliction or Curse (P)</summary>

By spending a minute examining someone who suffers from an affliction or curse, you can determine its exact effects. You also know the exact method on how to cure the affliction or remove the curse.

T1 afflictions have a DC of 5. +5 to DC for each tier.

Curses have a DC of 10+spell lvl. If the effect was not a spell, then DC 10+(1/2 lvl of entity who inflicted curse).
