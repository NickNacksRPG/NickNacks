<summary>Create Diversion</summary>

As a standard action, you can shout something at your enemies to briefly get them to look the other way so you can give them the slip. Out of all creatures currently attending you, roll deception against the creature with the highest insight. If you succeed, you are able to roll stealth and people don't know where you went. This does not prevent people from being unable to find you again using perception.

<summary>Convey Secret Message (P)</summary>

By speaking in roundabout terms and making subtle gestures, you can communicate a simple idea (we need to leave, time to strike) while in company that might scrutinize. The DC to convey this message is 15. The intended recipient automatically understands the message. For anybody else listening, its insight DC to read between the lines is (10+your deception bonus).

<summary>Sucker Punch (P)</summary>

If you are in some kind of standoff where you aren't quite fighting your enemy yet, you can use this skill as a replacement for stealth to surprise your enemy with a melee attack. The enemy must be aware of you in order sucker punch, otherwise it is stealth. If you don't use an unarmed strike then you have disadvantage on this check.

Certain situations where you are not able to get close to your aggressors, such as having bows pointed at you on from a garrison above you, make sucker punching impossible.
