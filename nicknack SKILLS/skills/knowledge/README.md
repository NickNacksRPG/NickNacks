# Knowledge

All knowledge uses int.\
What you know. Knowledge is broken up into many different skills based on subject and each one has a subsection dedicated to monster lore of specific types of creatures. Monster lore isnâ€™t its own skill, but it has its own functions separate from the rest of individual knowledge skills. If a subject or creature falls into multiple categories, then players can choose whichever they like more, but an individual character can't roll multiple checks with different skills.

## <mark style="color:red;">ALL knowledge requires proficiency to roll.</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to know who an individual creature is and their relevance to the world, rather than their stats and abilities, the DC is usually dependent on how popular they are. Typically (22-lvl) with additional reductions to the DC if they are famous, or in a position of power. This could also include increases to the DC if they work to keep their identity and exploits hidden, or live remotely.

Adventurers are assumed to know basic things about monsters, like how constructs lack of anatomy grant them resistance to many effects or the properties of incorporeal creatures.  Monster lore checks are for figuring out more information about specific monsters. &#x20;

Monster stat blocks are broken up into sections.  Basic stats (saves, HP and AC), offense traits (breath weapons, dangerous auras, prominent spells), defense traits (healing abilities, elemental resistances), other traits (extra senses, extra movement options, out of combat abilities) and weaknesses/deep lore (lich's phylactery, vampires not appearing in mirrors). &#x20;

Rolling a monster lore check is something you can do as a free action once per turn. It is assumed that you also vocalize what you learn to your team. The base DC of a monster lore check is (10+creature's lvl).  By succeeding on a monster lore check, you can figure out a creature's basic stats and one other category.  Every 5 over the DC you roll, you figure out another category.  If a creature has nothing in a category, you choose another.

Creatures with the \[unique] tag in their entry increase monster lore DC by 5. Humanoids with class levels by default are assumed to have the \[unique] tag.
