# Stealth

Moving around while remaining unseen. If someone is looking for you in your immediate vicinity and you don't want to be seen, you roll stealth. Uses dex.

<mark style="color:green;">Special: Stealth and size</mark>

Size provides no numerical benefit or penalty.  The only thing that size effects relative to stealth is your ability to gain cover: Larger creatures have a harder time figuring out places to hide, while smaller creatures find it very easy.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Hide (immediate)</summary>

As long as you have total cover, partial concealment or total concealment, you can attempt to hide from your enemies as an immediate action. You remain hidden until no longer have total cover/concealment, you cast a spell, use a special ability, attack or someone spots you with perception. When you attack a creature after successfully hiding from them, they are DD until the end of your turn.

<summary>Pass Without Trace (P)</summary>

<summary>Dampen Presence</summary>

Blind sense does not function against you.

<details>

<summary>Stalker</summary>

Use stealth to trail someone without them noticing you. It is assumed that you keep your distance, only observing broad strokes what they do, but not things they say, write down etc. If you want to get a closer look to find such details, you take a -5 penalty to stealth.

Using stealth to stalk people can potentially become impossible without first circumventing protections against spying.

How often you roll stealth checks is determined by the situation, opposed by the creature you stalk.

*   Some general examplesâ€¦

    | Every 10 minutes | Target is wary, is in a place you are unwelcome or has bodyguards on watch |
    | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Every few hours  | Target is in a public place with limited spaces to hide                    |
    | Every few days   | Target is isolated in an environment with ample hiding spots               |
