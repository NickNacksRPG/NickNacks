# Linguistics

The lawyer skill that gets languages as a bonus. Uses int.

<details>

<summary>Interpret Text</summary>

You peruse a book, contract or other written work to quickly summarize what it says in one minute. The DC for most works is 10, but it changes based on the size and complexity of the work at hand. Failure indicates more time is necessary to understand what the text contains. Finding oddities in a contract requires an opposed linguistics check.

<summary>Polyglot (P)</summary>

With proficiency in linguistics you gain a new language for every level you have, and every new level you gain.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Write/Forge Official Documents (P)</summary>

Make contracts, forge signatures and make (fake?) documents look official. Noticing oddities in such documents requires an opposed linguistics check.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Encode/Decode (P)</summary>

You can write things in ways that are difficult to interpret without a cipher, such as disguising your forbidden ritual as a cookbook. The DC to your code is 11+(linguistics bonus). Creatures that know the code can read encoded text, but creatures that don't interpret the text as something else. To read encoded text, you must first crack the code, usually requiring at least a week of research. At the end of the week, roll a linguistics check versus the writerâ€™s DC to crack the code.
