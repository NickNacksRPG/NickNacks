Perception is the mechanism through which players can notice the unnoticed in the imagination game. Traps, hidden loot, secret entrances, unusual stimuli are a handful of the many things this skill is used for. Conditions such as bad weather and listening through walls can make perception difficult, or even impossible. Sleeping gives a -5 penalty.
