&#x20;Common modifiers to make the task more difficult can includeâ€¦\
\>The surfaces you are interacting with are wet or moving.\
\>You are swimming in substances other than water that are more grimy or viscous\
\>Extra reinforcements to enhance the structural soundness and prevent breakage

&#x20;Common modifiers to make the task less difficult can include\
\>You are climbing at a >90 degree angle, or the surface was designed to be climbed\
\>Flotation devices (driftwood, floaties)\
\>Age or fundamental flaws/weaknesses in the structure

&#x20;How much of something you want to destroy can also influence how difficult it is. If you want to tear a brick out of a wall, that would make breaking the stone easier. If you want to break down the entire wall, that is much more difficult.
