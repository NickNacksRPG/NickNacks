# Breaking Objects

Should we push over the tree or just cut it down? Players may find themselves in situations where it is unclear whether it would be more effective to just hack at their problem with their swords or try to break it open with brute strength. A lot of that depends on what it is you're trying to break and what it is you're using to break it.

As a general rule, if the substance that you're using is more tough, and could reasonably damage the object you'd like to destroy (hammers aren't good at cutting ropes for instance) then you can damage/break the object just by swinging at it. Some consideration should still be taken about the size and scale of the object. Adamantine might cut through stone like butter, but a 3-ft thick stick of butter would still take quite a bit of effort to cut through.

Use the following chart to determine roundabout how "tough" something is.
