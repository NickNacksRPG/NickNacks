Acrobatics can be used to cross slippery surfaces coated in things like ice or oil. The DC is 10. Failing the check give you the knocked down condition until the start of your next turn. It can also be used to traverse or stand on incredibly small and unstable space such as a cliff side or a fallen tree branch.

You can also roll acrobatics to determine your jump distance/height to see if you can jump farther than your default jump distance. The distance you jump is equal to your acrobatics roll in feet, or half that in height. This still requires a swift action to perform.

**IF** you are proficient in acrobatics, your default jump distance is increased by points in dex or str.

Jumping does not increase your speed, and is thus limited by your movement speed.

As long as there are 2 walls within 5 feet of each other, you can continually hop between them to ascend. Only the upward distance you cover counts against your movement.

Acrobatics is rolled against all threatening creaturesâ€™ reflex saves. The DC of their reflex save is equal to your acrobatics roll. If they succeed, you provoke as normal.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Soften Fall</mark></summary>

When you take the jump action, you reduce falling damage by your acrobatics roll.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Excuse me</mark></summary>

You can move through creature spaces without provoking from said creature, but you cannot end your turn inside of a creature's space. Strafing no longer provokes AoOs.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Hopping</mark></summary>

You can jump as a free action once each turn.
