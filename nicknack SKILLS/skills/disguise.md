# Disguise

Pretend to be someone you’re not. Rolled against perception. Uses cha.

<details>

<summary>Craft Disguise</summary>

Spend 10 minutes perfecting your makeup, outfit and wig to appear as a playable race you're not. Disguise checks are usually unnecessary unless you fall under scrutiny, the person knows you/what you're pretending to be or you're trying to enter an exclusive club.  Creatures get bonuses to their perception if they know you or what you're disguised as particularly well.

You take a  -2 penalty to disguise checks when you try to change your race and when you change your apparent gender. When you initiate a disguise, you tell your DM your bonus, they apply any appropriate modifiers and roll it in secret.

Crafting a disguise without a disguise kit or magic imposes a -5 penalty.

<summary>Impressionist (P)</summary>

Creatures proficient in the disguise skill have the ability to alter their voice significantly. If a creature can’t see you (or while you are disguised), you can pretend to sound like someone else whose voice you have heard, or something more exotic like an animal. If a creature sees you and the voice is a mismatch, then they will quickly see through obvious facades, but can potentially be used to misdirect.

<summary>Zero to Hero</summary>

You can change your disguise into something completely different as a FRA. If someone was looking for you, they automatically get a check to see through your disguise if they see you again.

<summary>Costume Expert</summary>

You no longer take a penalty to disguise when changing your race or gender.

You can now use disguise to pretend to be a monstrous creature (skeleton, phoenix, giant). These disguises tend to be very bulky and impractical. You cannot do anything physically intensive while in such a disguise, such as acrobatics, athletics or combat without the disguise falling apart.
