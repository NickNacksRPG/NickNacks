# Survival

The day to day things that need to be done when out and about adventuring far from home in the wilderness. Uses wis.

<details>

<summary>Navigation</summary>

You can attempt to not travel in circles when moving through unfamiliar territory. Failure indicates that a lesser amount of progress is made towards reaching your destination, or arriving at an unintended destination.

<details>

<summary>Extract Resources</summary>

You can skin creatures, extract organs/fluids and other resources from recently killed creatures. This usually takes 1 minute. You get an amount of value equal to (10+the creature's lvl). \
Particularly dangerous or delicate operations require proficiency and a survival check (usually 10+creature's level), with higher value multipliers. A failed attempt represents the resources being destroyed.

<summary>Live off the Land (P)</summary>

Characters proficient in survival can sustain themselves and 4 other creatures in environments with suitable sources of food and water.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Tracking (P)</summary>

You can attempt to follow footprints, broken branches, scent trails and other disturbed natural elements to figure out where a creature has been and where itâ€™s going. With ideal conditions you can follow trails made days or even weeks ago (if you don't believe me, look at dino footprint fossils :^). The longer it's been since the creature has been there and the less ideal the conditions, the higher the DC.

<summary>Sniff Them Out</summary>

You gain blindsense (scent 5 ft).\
If you already have scent, increase its range by 5 ft.

<details>

<summary>Advanced Tracking</summary>

You can use survival to track creatures that fly and swim using scent, even if you aren't aquatic. It's harder to determine "ideal conditions" in these types of environments, so the DC is mostly based off of how long ago the creature was present.
