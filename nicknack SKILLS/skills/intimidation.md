Be spooky and coerce creatures. Uses the higher value of either your str, or your cha.

<summary>Demoralize</summary>

As a standard action, inflict shaken 1 on an enemy that can see or hear you within 30 feet. Must have line of sight. They roll a will save vs (10+your intimidation bonus). They are shaken as long as you are nearby, and for 1 minute after. You can demoralize a creature repeatedly to increase the penalty. If they pass their save, their shaken value decreases by 1.

<summary>Coercion (P)</summary>

By having a conversation with a creature that lasts at least one minute, or by defeating a creature in combat, you can shape how they respond to you or anybody asking about you in the future. The strength of this creature's conviction is dependent on your intimidation roll against it.&#x20;

You can make the creature keep their mouth shut about something you did to them. Any checks to gather information from this creature about you or your party change to this roll if it would be higher than the usual DC.

You can greatly exaggerate what you did to further spread fear and grand tales of your strength. Any knowledge checks that creatures make on you when hearing about information that spreads from this creature changes to your intimidation roll if it would be higher than the usual DC, or else they learn false info.

<summary>PTSD (P)</summary>

You can permanently scar a creature so that your mere presence is enough to fill it with dread. Creatures you defeat in combat are automatically shaken 1 in your presence permanently. If you successfully demoralize a creature afflicted with PTSD, you can choose to increase their shaken penalty or make them frightened.
