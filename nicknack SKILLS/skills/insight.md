<summary>Detect Truth</summary>

Whenever a creature makes a statement, you can roll insight (opposed by deception) to see if what they say aligns with what they think. If you succeed, you determine that something is fishy. Prying further about the deception may cause the creature to reveal the truth or become hostile depending on context.

If you roll this too often, your DM can silence you.  No using insight multiple times on the same thing.  Donâ€™t be silly.

<summary>Detect Intrusive Presence (P)</summary>

You can use insight to determine when a creature is under duress from a spell or some other kind of effect that has a lasting impact on their mind, such as domination or possession. You must actively search for this by speaking with a creature for 1 minute. Roll insight vs the DC of the effect. If the effect has no DC, assume basic DC with cha as the modifier.
