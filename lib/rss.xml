Requirement - Murder 3 people you once considered allies, or who at thought you were an ally (before you turned on them). If you murder someone in a position of great power, like a powerful guild leader or king, it counts as 3.<br>Reward - You have a 6th sense for when people trust you.

Requirement - Get defeated by a critical hit and survive in 3 different encounters. Or get crit 3 times in the same combat and survive.<br>Reward - The scars you get from battle are deeply entrenched in your memory. Your memories of combats you have encountered cannot be magically removed. By touching them, you can perfectly recall past events, as long as they happened in the thick of combat.

Requirement - Use stealth to initiate combat on a creature by patting its head 3 times. This pat can have no mechanical effect such as delivering a spell or attacking.<br>Reward - You unlock the "Pet" skill. It uses your stealth bonus. If you sneak up on a creature and pet their head (again, no additional mechanical effect), you establish dominance, giving you a +2 bonus to skills for the subsequent social or combat encounter. If a creature within reach is smaller than you, you can pet them as a free action 1/turn for no mechanical benefit (no save).]]></description><link>.\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\classes\class\achievements\critical-pet.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Classes/Class/Achievements/Critical Pet.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malon Elenia]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 05:46:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Character Creation]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>This game is played turn-based, with turn order determined at the start of the battle with an Initiative roll. The actions you can take on your turn are as follows.<br>
<br>
<a data-href="Standard Action" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\actions\action-system\standard-action.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Standard Action</a>: This action occupies most of your turn, and you can perform one per turn.

<br>Example: The Attack Action is the most common, allowing a series of smaller attacks up to your Attack Speed, executed in any order. Refer to the "Attack" section for more details.<br>



<br>
<a data-href="Swift Action" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\actions\action-system\swift-action.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Swift Action</a>: This action can be executed during any other action, with a limit of one per turn.

<br>
<a data-href="Free Action" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\actions\action-system\free-action.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Free Action</a>: These actions are effortless or part of other actions, allowing you to perform as many as you wish per turn - within reason.

<br>
<a data-href="Full-Round Action" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\actions\action-system\full-round-action.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Full-Round Action</a>: This action requires the use of your standard action and all of your free <a data-href="Movement" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\actions\action-system\movement\movement.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Movement</a>. You may still move if you have an ability that allows extra movement as a different action.<br>


<br>When it's not your turn, you can take the following actions:<br>
<br>
<a data-href="Immediate Action" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\actions\action-system\immediate-action.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Immediate Action</a>: A Swift Action that can occur off-turn. Limited to one per round, shared with Swift Action — you cannot use both in the same round.

<br>
<a data-href="Instant Action" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\actions\action-system\instant-action.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Instant Action</a>: A Free Action that can occur off-turn. Referred to as "Instantly" in abilities.

Limited to one per round. When a creature "Provokes," they are engaging in an action that allows others to AoO them.

 <br>When creatures don't surrender, but you don’t want to risk killing them, restraints can be used to end the fight. Some situations can naturally be neutralized by dropping a cage in the right place, but such conveniences are rare.

 <br>During combat there come times when you do not wish to fight, usually when one side is close to victory, but can also happen when creatures are clearly outnumbered or outmatched.<br>How well a surrender feels in a situation usually comes down to a gut feeling, affected by a lot of variables. In order to even consider a surrender to be viable, one or more of the following (or other applicable) conditions should be met…<br>
Numbers advantage<br>
Some other clear advantage, such as terrain, positioning, equipment or a powerful noteworthy ally<br>
Heavily damaged or unconscious allies<br>
Consequences for not surrendering (often death or further prosecution)<br>
Hostages<br>
Whether or not creatures are minions or named characters
<br>A surrender requires clear communication, which may not always be possible given the hectic and spread out nature of battle. Some creatures, particularly mindless ones, will not surrender unless specific circumstances are met. Creatures of animal intelligence can be convinced to surrender if you can speak to animals or have wild empathy etc.<br>Surrender can mean forfeiting weapons, fleeing in fear, begging for mercy or something similar.

 <br>In situations where there are two opposing sides that are generally neutral towards each other or even allies with each other, you can call for a truce. This generally requires important information (we were sent by the merchants guild), certification from an important or recognizable organization (legal documentation) or a special item (an artifact or flag).<br>It could also be appropriate to call for a truce if you are delving into a dungeon and encounter another party, so long as you aren't after the same thing. You might not cooperate, but at least you won't be killing each other. If more information is revealed by talking throughout a battle (wait you're also hunting for the garbooni?), you can also reasonably call for a truce.]]></description><link>.\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\alternative-win-conditions\truce.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Rules, How to Play/Alternative Win Conditions/Truce.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malon Elenia]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 07:25:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Action-Attack]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>The purpose of resurrection in TTRPGs is primarily for the benefit of the players. If a DM makes frequent use of the resurrection spells for entities that the players went to great lengths to kill, it heavily undermines their effort and feels terrible, even if plausible.<br>The powers that be should instead be very particular about the who gets a second chance. If the players are the main character of the story, then the game's resurrection mechanics should treat them as such. As a replacement for most resurrection effects, use these rules instead. Or don't use resurrection at all. It's your game. Whatever.<br>IMPORTANT NOTE: Please make sure your players are on board with whatever you decide. Nobody likes surprise mechanics.<br>See:<br>

At-Will abilities can be used as you like, without affecting the Mana Slot.

<br>
Recharge abilities will temporarily consume the slot until you use the <a data-href="Recharge Abilities" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\actions\common-actions\swift-actions\recharge-abilities.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Recharge Abilities</a> action. You do not need to re-prepare the ability, it returns to the slot as if it was not spent once you use the recharge action.

<br>
Limited abilities will make you lose the slot until you Long Rest. You can re-prepare the ability to assign it to a different slot and continue to use it.

 <br>In media it's very common for creatures to have minions, squires and sidekicks. This is what the companion system is for. Like most other content, the companion system is ill-suited for large quantities of creatures, like armies. It's meant to be more compact. Something to take with you on the go for your adventure. This could also reasonably extend to temporary allies that join your party.<br>Companions are generally tied to your class, abilities and items. Any such ability is marked with this tag.<br>If an ability has the companion tag, it summons an ally, or otherwise serves some kind of interpersonal function. <br>
You can only have 2 companions, or 1 if you have -1 <a data-href="CHA" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\ability-scores\cha.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CHA</a>.<br>
Companions always act on your turn if you are present. There is no separation between your turns, you all act in the same <a data-href="Initiative" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\abbreviations-and-terminology\initiative.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Initiative</a> (rolled by you).<br>
Companions gain bonuses or penalties based off of your CHA.

If you cast a spell with concentration, you must hold the staff in order to maintain your concentration. Being disarmed of a staff you are using to concentrate ends the effect.

 <br>This game relies on a special roll, detailed below.

 <br>Estimating the true value of a single unit of currency is difficult to do when considering the possibilities of every setting. However, in order to establish some reference for pricing adventuring gear and items, we have to settle on one - so, for the purposes of the default pricing and earnings, we're going forward with the assumption that the differences between the peasants, tradesmen, and aristocrats is large, but not in such a way that compromises the ability of the peasantry to afford basic items.<br>As a fantasy setting with swords and monsters, there are comparisons to be made to the value of labor in the medieval era. However, in order to avoid mixing the complexities of medieval economics with magic and superheroes to an audience that may not have studied such, the gap between the peasants and aristocrats is reduced, and social mobility is substantially increased.<br>

Another benefit of this minting is that it causes gold pieces to naturally stack into specific values (5, 10, 20, 100, 1000). Someone can easily hold 100g in their pockets, or 1000g in a dedicated pouch. Anything more and they are bursting at the seams and would be better off with a bank, or to switch to alternative methods of payment.<br>Carrying around a bag of 100,000g would be like the real-world equivalent of carrying around a several briefcases full of paper currency.

 <br>The Equivocation of Optional Mechanics as Difficulty Management in Video Games<br><br>In the ongoing conversation about difficulty in games, it is crucial to recognize the different ways designers shape challenge—whether through numeric adjustments, increased enemy complexity, or opt-in mechanics like summoning or assistive features. Unfortunately, many argue that all optional mechanics are neutral tools for difficulty management that do not impact the core gameplay experience. As players and developers, we should focus on creating environments that allow individuals to experience the game in the way they prefer—including doing so without imposing significant changes that undermine the integrity of the core challenge. The goal should be to empower players while respecting both the game’s design and their personal approach to difficulty.<br><br>In the gaming landscape, the design of difficulty and balance is a necessary part of accessibility for users with handicaps - especially in harder titles. Players that are too old or too new, that have responsibilities that pull them from the game, limited time, or that simply lack the necessary abilities to enjoy a game should have the necessary means to level the playing field.<br>
The design of difficulty in games can be broadly categorized into three distinct approaches: numeric, complexity-based, and opt-in mechanics. <br>
<br>Numeric difficulty involves straightforward adjustments such as increasing enemy health, damage output, or resource scarcity, making encounters more difficult through quantifiable means. This is the most simple approach, and is used as part of the other approaches - but alone is often only appropriate for games with minimalist mechanics and low skill expression.
<br>Complexity-based difficulty, on the other hand, will change enemies to act with more intelligence, have more varied abilities and attack patterns, and require players to master the mechanics already present in the game to keep up. This is often the preferred method for any game with strategy or skill expression, but is the most taxing to implement.
<br>Finally, opt-in mechanics—such as summoning allies, flying, or activating other assistive features—allow players to choose whether to bypass or mitigate certain challenges altogether. While these mechanics are often presented as optional tools for difficulty management, their adoption and integration can fundamentally alter the player’s experience. 
<br>There's a clear outlier here. There are no limits to what developers can put into their games as "optional" mechanics. The flexibility is a double-edged sword, as the implementation can just as easily ruin the experience if there is not an appropriate alternative or less invasive means. <br>For the purposes of this discussion, I will mainly refer to Skyrim, Mario, and Elden Ring.<br><br>All three methods of designing difficulty can easily interrupt the core gameplay experience when implemented thoughtlessly. <br>In Skyrim, there is very little strategy and skill expression. At best, the player can move out of the range of some enemy attacks and strike back between them, or properly aim an arrow. Beyond that, the game is no different to MMOs such as RuneScape, where the player either engages in a slap fight whose winner is determined entirely by opposing statistics and how much healing is in their inventories, or the player stands out of reach of a melee opponent and attacks them with ranged weapons until they die helplessly.<br>
Skyrim uses numeric difficulty. Despite being the easiest approach, there are major oversights in its implementation that force players to use specific playstyles or exploits to keep up. For example, a player that wants to use primarily destruction magic will be greatly disappointed on higher difficulties as their entire Magicka bar is depleted defeating a single lesser bandit, and the abysmal regeneration rate and lack of potions will force them to resort to sword fighting or the use of AI exploits and loading zones. As the game progresses, the only way to have enough Magicka to defeat enemies without hours of grinding is through Alchemy-Enchanting exploits that bring the cost of spells to 0, or their damage to arbitrarily high numbers—the latter of which completely defeats the purpose of the numeric difficulty increase.<br>Complexity-based difficulty is the hardest to implement. With the exception of complexity through AI improvements, it requires making more content on top of what should already be an adequate amount of content for lower difficulties. The more mechanics an enemy has, the higher the odds that they will invalidate a certain method of playing the game and require players to do something they are not interested in. For example, if the difficulty is in higher enemy aggression, then any playstyle that relies on large openings is going to suffer disproportionately. If the difficulty is in close-range incapacitation, then melee players will suffer more than ranged ones. Sacrificing some part of the original experience is often inevitable.<br>
There are exceptions where the numeric and complexity approaches meet. The speed of a game and the precision of its timings are a good example—Most of the game remains untouched, and a small adjustment in the reaction time necessary to beat the game can be the difficulty a player wants.<br>At the crux of the issue lies difficulty through optional mechanics. These are the most likely to change the experience of a player.<br>
In Elden Ring, the variety of abilities in the game ranges from completely impractical to game-trivializing superpowers. Some are very similar to each other, such as two weapons of the same class with similar movesets that have wildly different performance. Most are not at all similar, making the experience when switching from one to the next completely different. Despite this, one could make an argument that the difficulty in the game rises from which strategies the player chooses.<br>
The most polarizing optional mechanic is Summoning. This changes the game from single player to Co-Op vs AI, or Co-Op and AI vs AI. Using this, a player can use NPC assistants to make enemies ignore the player, or simply ask a friend to beat the game for them while they watch. The extreme nature of this mechanic has caused heated debate in online communities as to what extent an optional mechanic can be used to manage difficulty before it simply becomes thinly veiled cheating.<br><br>Cheating in most games is simply breaking the rules to your benefit. In the context of early video games, cheating was specifically programmed into games using "cheat codes" that would allow players to break the rules. Later, specialized pieces of hardware such as Action Replay were introduced that are akin to modern hex editors, allowing players to cheat by changing any variable they could find, far beyond what developers willingly included in their games. All of these were widely agreed to be forms of cheating.<br>
And yet, the definition of cheating became more flexible as time passed, even though little changed in what players were capable of.<br>In Super Mario games, there exist powerups that grant the player complete invincibility combined with another powerup that only appear when a player has died in a level multiple times. These are essentially easily accessible god modes that can be used to skip content that is too difficult or boring to play normally, or for any other reason the players see fit.<br>
There is no code that needs to be input. There is no need to go out of one's way to obtain these powerups. They aren't even labeled as cheats. They are even included with explicit intent to be used by a portion of the player base—while many cheats in the past were added just for the sake of having cheats (such as with Big Head Mode) or as rewards for completing the game.<br>
And yet, despite the lack of labeling, there is a subtle acknowledgement that using these is different than beating the game "normally." Achievements and collectibles will look different, scores may be altered, and the game otherwise records your use of these items to give your completion of the game an asterisk.<br>The difference between invincibility powerups and other cheats is that invincibility powerups are deliberate additions intended to help players of lower skill or patience complete the game. They are easy, low-effort inclusions that sacrifice a portion of the gameplay for an easier experience, which would sour the experience for players that do not need them. They are still, however, cheats. They break the rules to your benefit.<br>In Skyrim (PC), the player can, at any time, open the console to manipulate the game via console commands. This is more akin to classic cheat codes, where no player would be able to guess what they need to type into the console to cause a specific effect without looking up the codes, but is closer to the power of hex editors in terms of possibilities.<br>
Skyrim's console blurs the concept of cheating far more than a handicap feature would. Unlike other cheat codes, the use of the console is far more common even among players that do not like cheats for one reason: Skyrim does not function as a game.<br>
Did the player get stuck in random map geometry? The console allows them to teleport out. Did a quest break? The console can skip to the next step. Did the game crash? The console can be used to restore progress without needing to replay content.<br>By definition, these are all instances of cheating, yet many would decline to call it such. Cheating has a harsh connotation that someone is cheapening an experience by breaking the rules, and yet this time the cheats are used specifically to improve the experience of a broken game—and arguably play closer to the rules as intended.<br><br>How do you know what a developer's intentions are? Intuition is a helpful tool, but it is also often wrong. Unless someone spoke their intentions, there cannot be certainty... But we can still make reasonably educated guesses.<br>In Elden Ring, a common argument in favor of using anything the game offers is that, if it's in the game, it's intended to be used. The developers wouldn't have added it if they didn't intend for players to use it. This is obviously a baseless assertion, and there are plenty of examples where this intuitive reasoning falls short.<br>
Soon after the game's release, there were debates as to whether or not weapons such as Rivers of Blood and summons such as Mimic Tear were so powerful as to be unintended, or even be considered cheating. Players that defended these inclusions used the above argument, only to later find that both of these (and some underlying systems that improved them) were patched to reduce their effectiveness.<br>
Which one was truly the intended way of playing the game? Was it before or after the developers changed it? What else will the developers change? Can developers change their intentions?<br>
Some players that use this argument will make exceptions. For example, some enemies can be coerced into falling off of the map to their deaths, or get stuck such that they are easy targets. These will be exception cases, because their intuition tells them that the developers did not intend for enemies to simply fall off of the map and die on their own.<br>
And yet, despite the developers being able to modify the game however they wish, patches keep going by where these supposedly unintended inclusions remain untouched. <br>When observing the design of the game, it is reasonable to try and guess developer intentions based on conflicting design principles and a charitable interpretation of the intelligence of whoever made it, even without the say of the developers. If in the vast majority of cases a condition is true, except for one specific case where there does not seem to be any reason for the deviation, an argument can be made that the aberration is not intended.<br>
For example, in Elden Ring, there are almost always methods to avoid an instance of damage as a player of reasonable reaction time and positioning. Enemy attack patterns will place the attacks in such a way that that is always the case for their target. However, if there are multiple enemies, an attack may be placed in such a way that it is avoidable for the primary target, but not for any others nearby. This can be considered an unintentional side effect of the optional mechanic of multiplayer.<br>In Minecraft (Java Edition), players frequently modify the game using third party programs to drastically alter the gaming experience in ways far outside of the scope of the original game. It would be reasonable to assume that the intentions of the developer do not take into account anything a player may find in the landscape of unofficial changes to the game. Some of these modifications may be considered cheating, while most are considered changing the game entirely such that it is no longer "truly" Minecraft. However, there are modifications to the game whose only purpose is to improve the performance of the game, allowing more players the ability to play the game at all. Some modifications fix behaviors and perceived oversights to make the game more consistent.<br>Are these third party changes bringing the experience closer to what was intended? The Minecraft speed-running community certainly thinks that some do. Performance-boosting modifications that do not change the basic rules of the game are allowed and encouraged. It's intuitive that the game running better rather than worse is the intention of the developers. Being able to reset the game more quickly or load faster are generally accepted to not be considered in the realm of cheating due to not affecting the integrity of the performance of the player during their speed-run.<br>There it is—Integrity. <br><br>There is a sort of principled superiority that cheating is playing the game "wrong," and that accomplishments that were only acquired via cheating are illegitimate. This intuitive understanding is highly attractive, as speaking with someone who claims the same accomplishments as yourself while having a different experience reaching that goal will inevitably cause a disconnect. It can invoke feelings of mockery, as if your efforts are being undermined and cheapened by someone with a GameShark. Cheaters that are perceived to lack integrity are seen as dishonest and insincere.<br>It is no surprise that people will be on the lookout for any examples of something that can be seen as cheating. Whenever there are perceived rules and the perceived breaking of said rules, there will be conflict among players. Developers should keep this aspect of human nature in mind when designing their game, especially if they do not put any effort into explaining their intentions to the players. <br>Players are less inclined to fuss about cheating and accomplishments when difficulty and handicaps are properly communicated to them. When numeric and complexity difficulties are clearly labeled "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard" with descriptions of their effects, and opt-in mechanics are properly balanced or labeled as handicaps, players are more likely to be able to have civil discussions about the game's design.<br>At the end of the day, the purpose of games is to have fun. Players will act in accordance with what they find most enjoyable (and accessible), and they will associate with other players that have similar values to their own. Players are also not expected to have the emotional intelligence or logic capacity to put together well-reasoned and compassionate arguments to connect with others that do not think like them. They are expected to complain, pick sides, and attack anyone with opposing views, needlessly causing divides that the developers could have easily avoided.<br><br>Elden Ring is a gold mine of thoughtless arguments and assumptions from players due to the vague and often half-baked implementation of its core difficulty management mechanics. For this, we will be focusing on the debate around the users of summons against solo/difficulty purists, as both sides suffer from astounding levels of shortsightedness on the subject.<br>Let's start with solo purists that claim that anyone that used summons did not truly "beat the game" and that they "played the game wrong." There are legitimate arguments to be made about the poor implementation and incredible variance in effectiveness from the use of summons. Truly, they can be akin to using a Super Leaf in Mario games to skip entire areas and bosses from the sheer power that having another player or ally in a fight can bring. The way enemies do not take into account the presence of additional enemies for their choice of actions reveals a lack of polish or worse. In some cases, enemy AI will simply cease to function when a creature is defeated, or their movements and bodies will become unnatural as they change targets mid-attack, resulting in deceptive and jarring visuals that do not appear as intended behavior.<br>
However, there is no reason to attack others for choices made for the purposes of entertainment in what may as well be a single-player game. Without the developers defining what it means to beat the game, like in Mario, the player's assertions are baseless.<br>As the player progresses further into the game, many of the enemies have identical gameplay with only minor cosmetic differences—and enormously increased statistics. It is not uncommon for a player to fight a generic soldier with a sword and trade hits to defeat them in one blow, only to find the exact same enemy wearing a different color shirt that can kill the player in a single blow. It is entirely possible for a player to simply not have enough ammunition to defeat even a single enemy from differences in numeric difficulty, resulting in certain playstyles being invalidated via arithmetic impossibility. What would normally be a method of difficulty control instead becomes a burden for the player to level up their character to unreasonable strength, skewing the experience unnecessarily because of arbitrary restrictions from the developers.<br>
Furthermore, the action of increasing one's level has no relation to the core gameplay experience or player skill. If a player wishes to improve their numerical abilities until winning is possible, they will most likely resort to repeatedly resting at a save point and attacking defenseless enemies for an arbitrary amount of time until they have enough points to do so. There is no option to use skill to increase one's ability to deal damage when the resources used to do so are limited - if you have ten shots, and the enemy can survive eleven, no amount of skill will help you win. The increase in "difficulty" using numbers serves no purpose except to waste hours of a player's time when players opt for weaker strategies.<br>Strategies and weapons that are stronger or weaker are often touted as the game's main way of adjusting difficulty. In many cases, these are legitimate, non-invasive methods that do not significantly alter the core gameplay experience. If a player likes a specific kind of weapon or spell, chances are there are alternatives that function similarly enough while being substantially more or less effective. It's always easier to reduce effectiveness, as a player can choose not to upgrade a weapon, but it is not always possible to increase the strength of a playstyle past a certain point. That is the point at which this method of difficulty implementation fails. <br>It is a common argument among users of summons that anyone that complains about numeric difficulty while refusing to use opt-in playstyles is trapped in a cage of their own making. This view isn't just false, it's patronizing and misses the valid portion of the purist argument. Summoning, for example, changes the core experience of the game to such a degree that it can and will lead to questions of integrity and legitimacy in a run. Even inexperienced players identify that someone or something else defeating enemies for them "feels" like it made their own contributions irrelevant (because it did).<br>That all tools the game offers are equally valid means of managing difficulty is an equivocation. To insist others use them in the same way they would an "enemy health and damage multiplier" lacks nuance and borders on dishonesty. To the purists, telling them to "just summon" is no different than telling them to "just play Tetris instead," "just use the Super Leaf," or "have you considered handing the controller to your big brother?" since, to them, it is either an alternative game experience that doesn't interest them, or actively cheapens the experience of the game akin to cheating, even if the developers did not say such. To them, the game simply lacks the means to make their chosen way of playing the right difficulty, and their way of playing the game for entertainment is just as valid as the summoners.<br>This problem also exists in reverse. For example, what if someone wants to play with their friends, but does not want to make the game too easy? There are numeric ways to make yourself weaker, but the core experience is warped. No amount of self-restriction will make up for the fact that enemies in the game are not designed to act differently in the presence of multiple opponents.<br>There is one last drawback of opt-in mechanics as difficulty, especially in Elden Ring: Not all mechanics are even available from the start. If you want to play the game from start to finish with Godfrey's Axe, you are required to either arrange for another player to drop the item for you, or you need to cheat. That's right: there are playstyles that are not even accessible. The game does not have a reasonable method to enjoy items granted only after beating the game. This is not even for balance reasons either, as items like Fire Giant's braid and Godfrey's Axe are incredibly weak weapons compared to similar ones obtainable earlier in the game. Limited items exist that never respawn or force players to waste time collecting rare resources, which needlessly punishes inexperienced or challenge run players that are more likely to fail when using them. <br>Given everything discussed, using cheats for the purposes of enabling the game to be played in a specific way that does not affect the integrity of the core gameplay is something that should be reasonable to most. The issue is not cheating, it's integrity. There should always be methods of controlling difficulty within a given set of rules while respecting those rules, self-imposed or otherwise. If the developers fail to do so, it is perfectly within reason for players to point it out.]]></description><link>.\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\game-design-rambling\difficulty-and-integrity.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Game Design Rambling/Difficulty and Integrity.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malon Elenia]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 19:29:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Math and Worldbuilding]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>The Neglect of Mathematics and Game Balance in Tabletop Roleplaying Games<br><br>In all forms of interactive storytelling where numbers are involved, the narratives and imaginations of those involved are grounded in and informed by the underlying mathematics and mechanics. Just like in the real world, math is the basis on which everything exists - change one variable, and the world and the cultures within will look much different. Despite this foundational importance, the math in TTRPGs is often neglected or not taken into consideration during its creation, causing the stories built on it to lack plausibility or the players to engage in degenerate gameplay loops that are better incentivized by the math. We must elevate the standards of game balance and mathematical principles within to ensure a stable play environment with maximal freedom of storytelling.<br>For the purpose of this discussion, I'll mostly be referring to the design of Dungeons and Dragons, but these principles extend to all games, TTRPG or otherwise.<br><br><br>Here in the real world, our actions are most often decided by their expected outcomes. People grow the food that produces the most in the local terrain, they wear protection to avoid death, they take the path of least resistance, they outlaw actions that harm others. If the outcomes or goals were different, the actions taken would be different - if stabbing someone was a pleasant experience that extended their lifespan, then the laws around stabbing people would be very different. If we only ate for pleasure, we would grow what tasted the best regardless of climate.&nbsp;<br>This is true down to the very foundations of the universe, where the actions that the atoms and forces of the universe take are decided by simple rules. Light takes the path of least time, mass and energy act towards increased entropy, and other such rules determine how everything else acts.<br>Just like in real life, expected outcomes are what guide us in TTRPGs. If the goal of the player is to live the longest and kill the most things, then the actions they take will be guided by what best gets them to that goal. Because this is based on probability, it becomes a question of simple math to determine the best course of action at a given moment. All else the same, the weapon that does the most damage should be what everybody in the world defaults to. All else the same, the strategy that prevents the most damage taken is the best.&nbsp;<br>Math IS worldbuilding.&nbsp;<br><br>In real life, we can't fight against monsters and men-at-arms with shuriken and our bare fists. Reality dictates that those actions would likely result in our demise. However, in a game, we often find ourselves roleplaying something that isn't exactly realistic - such as a magician slinging fireballs at ogres. If we want to allow the full range of themes to be represented in a game, we need all of them to be on a fair playing field. There is no purpose to allowing "Unarmed Strike" as an action that accomplishes nothing and gets you killed, after all - but we decide the rules of this universe. We can make "Unarmed Strike" deal substantial damage, or have additional benefits that make their use reasonable. By setting the rules properly, what is feasible changes to match our desires.<br>Whether what you desire is a good thing is a discussion for another day - let's focus on the hows.<br>What players do is a combination of what they desire, and what the game rewards. Developers should set the rules to reward what they want to happen, and not reward what they don't. Ideally, the incentives should match what the players want to do.<br><br>The incentive structure of a game like DnD usually comes in the form of power. More money and experience means bigger and more magical swords and fireballs, or more hirelings, etcetera. When you want a fair game for players to enjoy various themes and strategies, you must balance the power such that there is not a single overwhelmingly dominant strategy that is easily recognized by players. This is only fair; if you have multiple players, and one is given obviously inferior power, they may experience frustration or disengagement when they notice their impact on the game is insubstantial as a result.<br>Fairness in a system of mathematics is fundamentally a question of mathematics.<br>When the underlying math is neglected, and the rest of the game is built despite it, you will quickly find oddities. If you make "Unarmed Strike" deal 1 damage, and "Longsword" deal between 1 and 8, you should not be surprised when nobody will opt for "Unarmed Strike" under any circumstances. If there is a dominant strategy, and yet you still declare that most of the people in this world fight with fists instead of swords (all else equal), your world becomes less believable. From the math, the rest of the world-building should come naturally and without significant leaps of logic - If you declare something exists in this world, there should be a basis for it, and this basis almost always comes from the math.<br>Balanced systems inherently foster deeper engagement. Players are more likely to invest their time into the mechanics of a game when they believe they will not be held back by deviating from superior strategies. By employing mathematical approaches to skill scaling, damage output, resource allocation, and character progression, players are free to choose options based on thematics, creativity, and their own desires without worrying about doing the math on behalf of the developers to make sure they are being dealt a fair hand.<br>Everything I've stated so far may seem obvious, and even patronizing, but the reality is that most developers do not take this into consideration as much as they should.<br><br>I'll spare you the fine details and skip to the important math to keep in mind.&nbsp;<br>In DnD, there are listed weapons that are assumed to be available from character creation. If we consider the world in which this takes place, it would be fair to assume that the people in the world would also want to survive encounters when selecting their weaponry, and those weapons are boiled down to sets of numbers and tags to describe them. The most important number to a commoner with no bonuses to anything is the damage number - in a fight, the odds to succeed are highest by simply using the weapon with the highest damage. And yet, a dagger deals 2.5 damage, while a stick deals 3.5. If they use a very big stick, they can even reach 4.5, if they don't mind using both hands. If they spend some more money and actions, they can use two axes for a whopping 7 damage, and this is only with "simple" weapons they may be proficient in.<br>The simple conclusion here is that, all else equal, a commoner's preferred weapon should be a stick, or two axes if they have money to spare. The stick is the most versatile, cheap, and powerful weapon available to them. Even if you take into account the bonuses from stats, a commoner would need maximum dexterity to consider a dagger, even compared to weapons they are not proficient in. In this world, using a dagger is mathematically inferior to every other option for any regular, non-player character.&nbsp;<br>This results in a silly world that only suits the players, without taking into account the rest of the creatures. Why would a knife be a substantially worse weapon than a stick?&nbsp;<br>A goat that attacks a human is likely to kill them in a single attack. How long would a farmer last in such a world?<br>Some classes and builds can easily survive far longer and deal multiple times as much damage as others, often while being better at non-combat activities as well. Why would anyone willingly choose to be the inferior class if the objective is to survive?&nbsp;<br>The expected earnings of a player far outpace the earnings of commoners, as untrained labor is only enough to pay for a gallon of ale or a stay at a poor inn while a single piece of basic equipment can be worth a hundred times as much. Is it really acceptable to put the price on a day of deadly work (such as a mercenary) equal to the price of a dagger, one of the worst items in the game, such that a player could hire dozens of them for every adventure?<br>How long can you ride on a player's goodwill and desire for thematics and roleplay before these poor worldbuilding decisions start to interfere with their fantasy?<br><br>One of the most insidious phenomena in the world of TTRPGs is the tendency of players to defend poor mathematics and imbalanced mechanics, often born out of a fundamental misunderstanding or intentional ignorance of underlying principles. This defense frequently stems from a place of trust in the developers and an emotional attachment to the game itself, leading players to uphold the perceived authority of the creators.<br><br>"If they wanted it that way, they would have made it that way!"<br>"You think they didn't think of that? They clearly left it like that for a reason."  <br>"Why don't you do better, then?"<br>When players encounter a system that is hailed as "official," there is a natural inclination to assume that the developers have meticulously crafted every detail, and thus, their choices are unquestionable. Players may erroneously believe that since the developers designed the game, they must have considered every possible variable and outcome, rendering any criticism unwarranted.&nbsp;<br>Players may also propagate the myth of developer infallibility, asserting that they are privy to unique insights that justify design decisions. Such attitudes not only inhibit constructive discourse, but they also diminish the validity of collective player experiences and insights, as an entire community’s lived experiences may be rendered irrelevant in the face of perceived expertise. The belief that there "can’t be a better way" is a common claim that started among video game developers, such as at Riot Games and Nexon, as they frequently cite data they claim exists to justify their actions while refusing to release said data to prove it. The truth is that no such data exists, and modern gaming communities can easily get access to or create superior data from which to make decisions.<br>When confronted with suggestions for rebalance, players often leap to the defense of their cherished mechanics, positing that the developers "must have had a reason" for their choices. This blind and aggressive defense of the systems further perpetuates the cycle of flawed designs, as those advocating for improvement or merely offering their observations are dismissed as "Powergamers," or told that they're just not focusing on what matters, and that roleplay trumps game design.<br>Because the foundation of these defenses is inherently fallacious, they almost always lead to a statement that reveals their lack of engagement with the topic. The most common ones include that the game is made to be changed from table to table, that the suggestions are merely opinions and do not represent the needs of the community, that the opinions of those that are not part of successful gaming companies are inherently worthless, and basic attacks on the character of those criticizing the game (rather than focusing on the criticisms themselves).<br><br>Most players lack the mathematical literacy necessary to fully grasp the implications of game mechanics at a detailed level. Consequently, when flaws in balance emerge—be they overpowered abilities, inefficient resource distribution, or underwhelming options—players may misinterpret these issues as subjective preferences rather than objective mathematical failings.&nbsp;<br>The most common misinterpretation of the math is that of percentage reductions: Most players do not know that reducing an effect by 100% is far more than twice as good as reducing it by 50%. A common way this ignorance appears is in video games such as League of Legends, Minecraft, and Skyrim, where players will honestly believe that combining a reduction of 50% with another 50% and getting a result of 75% is somehow a "diminished" effect because the total did not reach 100%, when in reality the result is a multiplicative, mathematically accurate, and fair way to represent the effect.<br>Combined with the aforementioned bias towards that which is "official," a majority of the population will convince themselves that their intuitive (incorrect) understanding of the underlying mathematics is also aligned with what the developers think - and, unfortunately, they may be correct.<br><br>The methods used by the developers of DnD to create the game and the underlying math is transparently dubious. By their own (unwitting) admission, the top-down approaches used by them with a lack of emphasis on mechanics and math, insufficient player testing, and dismissal of community feedback has led to books full of wondrous descriptions of a game that does not accurately match their vision in practice.<br>The examples of such are too numerous to list, but to bring up simultaneous examples that perfectly encapsulate the sheer nescience of the lead developers of DnD, we can look at the playtests of DnD 5.5. During the playtests, the developers made a particularly bizarre public video about the results, falsely claiming that a mechanic that players did not interact with was "mathematically one of the most powerful" when it was the worst on average, dismissing feedback because player scores on individual features were higher than the overall score, and even incorrectly referencing their own changes to their own content.&nbsp;<br>What truly happened behind the scenes to cause such a public statement to be made without any proofreading is unclear. It's up to a given individual to review these actions to decide whether it's negligence, ignorance, or deliberate equivocation. I try taking the most charitable approach by assigning ignorance to what could have just as easily been malice.<br><br>Game developers must adopt a mathematical mindset in their approach. This includes rigorous playtesting with statistical analyses, iterative balancing, and a commitment to utilizing clear metrics for evaluating the effectiveness and fairness of mechanics while maintaining consistency and logic. Checking published content for faults should not be the burden of the players, especially when the product is advertised as being beginner-friendly. Disparities that can be encountered within a new player's first turn should not be tolerated, let alone upheld as intended design.<br>Players should be involved in the balancing process, and even perceived faults in criticism should be thoroughly investigated to identify the underlying reasons for the criticisms being put forth. When a community is particularly large, there's a high likelihood that there will be individuals that practically design the game in its entirety in their criticisms. To dismiss them is the peak of hubris.&nbsp;<br>When a game's fundamentals and mathematical foundations are made airtight, the content built on them will likewise be untouchable. Under ideal circumstances, even inexperienced players should be able to expand on the content in the game with little worry of diminishing the balance. I hope to one day live in a world where criticisms of game balance and mathematics are truly in the realm of the nitpicking and biased, and that all game discussion becomes that of themes and abstractions.]]></description><link>.\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\game-design-rambling\math-and-worldbuilding.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Game Design Rambling/Math and Worldbuilding.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malon Elenia]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 22:55:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Half-Link]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Disarming a mage of their staff prevents them from casting using it, and ends any spell they're concentrating on with it.<br>"Staff" components do not need to be exclusively provided by staves. Many other items, such as wands and seals, can also be used to serve the Staff component.<br>
<br>
Staff - Staves are usually long and sturdy pieces of wood. Most of the magical components of the staff are attached to the end of it. Staves can universally be used as weapons, and may augment specific kinds of spells.

<br>
Seal - Seals have an enormous amount of variety to them. They are typically compact: Some small handheld object, often of spiritual significance. Seals are ineffective unless they are the only thing occupying the hand. Seals often alter the use of spells.

<br>
Wand - Wands are usually small pieces of wood about in the rough shape of a pencil, but usually a bit larger. Wands are lightweight and easy to bring many of, and may grant additional spells prepared.

<br>
<a data-href="Tome" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\Tome" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tome</a> - Tomes, grimoires, or otherwise magical books can often serve as Staff components. They can be used to prepare spells you do not know, and must be in hand when used to cast said spells.

<br><br>Any spell with a Material component has an item with a price associated with that is consumed on use. Anything with a Focus component has an item with a price associated that is NOT consumed on use.<br>You do not need to have these items in your hand - they merely need to be on your person to be used. They may briefly appear in the visuals of the spell or otherwise float out of your inventory as necessary.<br><br>All spells have a verbal component. Verbal components cannot be whispered, and you must speak them clearly. Anything that prevents the mage from speaking prevents them from casting, such as being silenced.<br>The verbal components often contain a plain-language reading of the spell's structure or its name, in a <a data-href="Language" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\skills\linguistics\language.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Language</a> known by the caster.

 <br>Spellcasting is a general title that applies to a specific type of magical effect, with specific rules. Spells do not encompass all magic, but it is the most common type.

 <br>A Technique is the form most abilities take. They are one of the major means of combat progression in the game. <br>Techniques are often things that you use in combat, but many have out-of-combat uses as well. Spells may contain a greater portion of out-of-combat effects.<br>Techniques are either martial or magic, in the form of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Spell" data-href="Spell" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\Spell" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Spells</a>.

They gain technique points at odd levels, or may automatically get a specific tree at those odd levels. Techniques are separated into five levels, requiring 6 points of investment in order to reach the highest tier.<br>Every even level, you get a technique point you can invest into any technique path, separate from what you get from your class. For every point you invest, you get access to a new level of technique.<br>Technique levels have a hard character <a data-href="LV" href=".\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\core-rules,-how-to-play\abbreviations-and-terminology\lv.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">LV</a> requirement when investing points to unlock more. At level 1, you can unlock the first tier, but every tier thereafter is available at every odd level, maxing out at tier 6 at level 11.]]></description><link>.\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\techniques\technique.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Techniques/Technique.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malon Elenia]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 09:10:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Template, Class]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Malon's Marvelous Misadventures is a TTRPG where the players take on the roles of capable adventurers in a fantasy world, facing off against the odds themselves as they plow through hordes and chow down on the rewards! It's centered on systems that maximize the ease of content creation and compatibility with what exists in other tactical TTRPGs.<br>The content provided will be enough to run relatively lighthearted fantasy games, and serves as a basis to create more and adapt it to your needs. The game mechanics are a blend of real-world intuition and game-y themes, setting a stage with a healthy amount of suspension of disbelief to allow more creative solutions to problems without worrying too much about adherence to realism.]]></description><link>.\https:\\malonsmarvelousmisadventures.com\🍔-mission-statement.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">🍔 Mission Statement.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malon Elenia]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 10:41:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Index]]></title><description><![CDATA[
