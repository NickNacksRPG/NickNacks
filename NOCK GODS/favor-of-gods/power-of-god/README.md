# Power of God

Gods are beings that have purposefully not been given stat blocks, because fighting a god via conventional means, that being swords and magic, is impossible. An ancient and powerful pact is in place that prevents the gods from seizing mortals as puppets to enact their will, and forces them to figure out more subtle and indirect means of acquiring what they want.

This same pact makes them immune to conventional weapons. Gods have so much mana flowing through them that no singular person is close to powerful enough to even scratch them. This same mana allows them to perform incredible feats, often referred to as miracles.&#x20;

Gods are free to walk amongst mortals only sparingly, as doing so requires a great deal of mana. As such they usually prefer only to appear in their [Deific Aspects](https://nick-nacks-rpg.gitbook.io/nicknacksrpg.com/classes/classes/ascendance/demigod), which only allow them to exert a fraction of their power, and appear as a translucent spectral version of themselves. They can also appear as a mortal, unable to exert any of their usual deific powers, and usually having a hard time gathering the attention of mortals. They also use other indirect means, such as using their followers as vessels, projecting only their voice or having their messages appear in writing via ink or blood.

Gods are not all-knowing, nor are they all-powerful. They have the ability to focus their attention on many places at once, with much greater detail in places where their followers exist. They hear and answer prayers while doing other things. Their ability to multi-task and process information is beyond comprehension. Certain types of things may draw their focus, such as hearing a prayer related to a matter that interests them, or a ritual in their honor conducted by one of their favorite disciples, or an enemy defacing their places of worship.

Gods must carefully consider what they focus their attention on, and what they do. Their existence may seem immutable, but the countless gods lost to time suggest otherwise. They must satisfy the desires of mortals, lest they lose their source of power. As such, gods tend to only give boons to the dedicated, and only make appearances amongst mortals if it can be flashy and garner a lot of attention.  A constant form of pageantry they must perform in order to maintain their power and increase their influence.
