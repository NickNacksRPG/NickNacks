# Demigods

There exist a great many lesser or local deities that are much less popular, and therefore do not follow the same kind of rules as the other gods. They are still more mortal than divine, and are free to exert their lesser influence directly in the mortal realm. [There are even rules on how a player character can become one](https://nick-nacks-rpg.gitbook.io/nicknacksrpg.com/classes/classes/ascendance/demigod).

These demon dukes, demigods and other lesser deities can be killed like any man. They do still have abilities similar to gods, such as the ability to grant boons, and project their deific aspect, however their ability to perform miracles is limited. Demigods must often fight tooth and nail to not fade into irrelevance once the next generation of mortals forgets them for their deeds.
