# ðŸŽŒ Anime Jesus

Anime Jesus is the anime god of order. He primarily concerns himself with the purging of corruption and evil in the realms beyond his own.&#x20;

The followers of AJ call themselves The Golden Order. Many that follow him mimic his powerful offensive magic in order to destroy aberrations, demons, undead and the mortals that serve/create them. Anime Jesus is not just concerned with the evil that exists on Nack, but also that which lies beyond the stars. A radioactive and corrupting force permeates the galaxy known as ligmanium. It twists and transforms all it comes into contact with, eventually spreading between planets. Destroying this substance at its source is the prime directive of AJ and his followers.
