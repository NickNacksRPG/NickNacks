# Brazzerian Purification

## <mark style="color:green;">Brazzerian Purification</mark>

The art of purification involves turning a fiend into mortal form, purging them of their inherently sinful natures. To do this requires a lot of time and effort to be successful. The bare minimum required in order to conduct the ritual is...

* Mana. 100\*(creature's lvl)^2. (1=100, 2=400, 3=900...12=14,400)
* Proficiency in planes.
* The creature's name before it transformed.

With all of the above ingredients, you can draw the magic circles required, power it, and initiate the ritual. The person in charge of performing the ritual rolls a DC 17 luck check to guess the creature's <mark style="color:red;">true name</mark>: A word in an ancient tongue meant to represent who a person is at the core of their soul. If successful, then it transforms into a [hellion](https://app.gitbook.com/s/RMbLojcVzvAZ0Dwd2Vjs/races/hellion). If it fails, it is evaporated, leaving only a silhouette and any of its gear/clothing behind.

Because this is such a slim chance of success, and creatures only get one shot, Brazzerian priests have done a great deal of research on how to improve the likelihood of a rituals success. Each of the below things can improve odds, adding additional bonuses to the luck check.

* (+1) Double the mana cost. This can stack, but it must be doubled each time.
* (+2) Convince the creature to be willing to transform, usually requiring appealing the the creatures ethos.
* (Up to +3) Have detailed information on who the creature was in life. Major things, like events they regret, cherished family/friends, major accomplishments contribute more.
* (Up to +3) Have items significant to what the creature was in life. Items like childhood treasures, wedding rings and signature weapons/armor contribute more.
* (+2) Perform ritual in sanctified area. Such areas are rare instances where Brazzeria has visited the realm of mortals to perform miracles, and are closely guarded treasures.

Other things can add to the bonus that aren't listed here as appropriate.

## <mark style="color:green;">Born Fiendish</mark>

In very rare instances, creatures can be born fiends, such as when they are the child of a demon lord. Such fiends ignore most of the aforementioned rules: They can automatically succeed on the ritual if they are willing, and it always fails if they are not.

Their changes tend to be less dramatic, allowing them to maintain most aspects of their fiendish form and powers, making them very rare catches for Brazzerians.
