# Hades

Hades is the god of the dead, and the dutiful arbiter of the underworld. Hades and those who work under him attend to the souls of the dead, carefully cataloguing and maintaining records of any souls that pass through the underworld and river Styx. Hades is an entity that his job very seriously, and has strict rules that apply to any inhabitants.&#x20;

He is often worshiped by initiate necromancers, much to his dismay. Hades despises necromancy, as it only causes problems for him. More adept necromancers understand the ire their activities bring to him, and tread lightly when around those his worshipers.

Hades is a massive humanoid with long dark hair and an exceptionally long mustache. Clad in the bones of the fallen, he wears a crimson toga and covers himself in other forms of regalia such as gold and jewels.
