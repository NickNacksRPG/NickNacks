# The Underworld

The Underworld is a physical location in the mortal realm, though its entrance is never something that stays in the same place for very long. Usually when too many people catch wind of its location, Hades will change it to another location. The entirety of the Underworld is Hades' domain, and he takes great care to make sure that he does not get unwanted guests, and that people do not escape.

The underworld is split up into several parts.

## <mark style="color:green;">The Styx</mark>

The River Styx in omnipresent throughout the Underworld. Wherever you stand, you can always see it snaking through the terrain. The entire Underworld is shaped around this mystical river. The liquid that flows through it changes based on the region of the Underworld. Pure in Elysium, lava in Asphodel and a crimson  blood-like liquid in most other places.

Exposure to the waters of the Styx has a variety of effects that depend on circumstances. Creatures who have lived exceptionally long lives are particularly resistant to the effects of the Styx while younger creatures are wiped clean very quickly. Taking a sip from the waters will not get rid of much but taking a plunge for just a minute can wipe away years of life. Typically more important memories are more resistant to the power of the Styx: Childhood memories, cherished loved ones, sense of self and important deeds.

## <mark style="color:green;">The Precipice</mark>

Starting from the entrance/exit is the precipice. Guarding the exit is the mighty three-headed beast Cerberus, standing as the Underworlds eternal guardian. He freely allows creatures to enter, but never allows them to leave. The precipice largely consists of twisted caves where the River Styx snakes around. Spirits of the dead often linger in the precipice as long as their will allows before inevitably passing through the Styx and washing up in front of Hades' desk. Creatures from the mortal realm wander into the Precipice quite frequently, filling its halls with beasts or mischievous creatures who like to desecrate Hades' altars and commune with lost spirits to lead them astray.&#x20;
