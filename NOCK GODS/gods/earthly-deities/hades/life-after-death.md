# Life After Death

When a person dies in the world of Nack, their soul separates from their body and is quickly pulled down into the Underworld. Most people plunge into the Styx immediately, losing all sense of self and becoming an amorphous unrecognizable spirit before washing up on a line in front of Hades' desk. Depending on the type of life they lived, they are sent to different areas of the Underworld. Many are given tasks to perform, the most popular of which are record keeping and patrolling the halls for those who would steal Hades' treasure or try to escape the Underworld.

Particularly strong-willed people are able to resist the pull towards the Styx for a bit longer, and are able to maintain most of their appearance, albeit a bit more ghostly. Creatures that curry favor with Hades are given access to the bodies they had in life and are still privy to many of their core memories.

Any and all attempts at resurrection show up on Hades' desk after the fact, and he decides how he wants to approach them on a case by case basis. Acts performed by other gods are out of his control, but noted for future dealings. Every instance of resurrection is considered a debt that must eventually be repayed. Sometimes when creatures cheat death, Hades will instruct his followers to hunt them down.&#x20;
