# üê∏ Frogg Saran

Frogg Saran is chaos incarnate. He is known to give blessings and curses in equal measure. Frogg Saran is a very active force in the world of Nack, worming his way into many people's lives whether they like it or not. All this god seeks is to increase the amount of entropy in the universe. His followers start riots and revolutions merely to change the status quo. They reincarnate people for the lulz, just to see the reaction to their new body.

Frogg Saran's odd fixation on the rubbery amphibious creature causes frogs to be revered by his followers. Special care should be taken when interacting with any frog or frog-adjacent creature, or risk unwittingly getting dragged into the machinations of this mad god. You never know when what looks like an ordinary frog could be a lunatic, or worse yet, Frogg himself in disguise.

The true form of Frogg Saran is unknown, though many suspect his true form is that of a smug frog, save for its eyes are replaced with gnashing maws. It is a common way he appears before mortals, but with other common occurrences being cheese and tentacles, some depict him as an otherworldly aberration, or a rodent..

{% hint style="info" %}
Because it is possible to have faith in Frogg with negative wisdom, he never reliably answers prayers. But when he does answer prayers, they are typically in unexpected ways, and tend to be useful in ways other than providing advice.

This could mean the place you are looking for suddenly explodes, the handsome fellow you were interested in talking to reveals they are a homosexual, or a frog will lead the way.

In any such case, the advice/assistance comes in a much more dramatic and roundabout way.

You can innately cast [reincarnate](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/frogg-saran/level-2/reincarnate) 1/day. When you cast reincarnate, you gain access to a random innate technique that you can use once. While you have this technique, you lose access to reincarnation. After you expend the technique, you regain access to reincarnation. See chart below for determining what technique you gain.

Using this technique as it is intended, AKA, not using it just to cycle to a new one, gives you 100 GBP. You cannot use this to farm GBP passively during down time. Up to DM interpretation what qualifies as "intended use." Usually it involves using the technique in combat, or if a utility effect, in an apt scenario, such as using [sending](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/larella/level-1/sending) to communicate with a random person you met today with a cryptic message.

<mark style="color:green;">T3: Forbidden Knowledge</mark>\
You can expend a use of prayer in order to find out forbidden lore concerning a creature you can see. Choose a random creature within 30 ft of you and then roll serendipity. The higher the roll, the more pertinent the information. This knowledge is always presented in a numerical format such as "2 kings killed" for important/secret high roll info or "0 dogs pet" for low impact knowledge.

When you truly believe, you are rewarded. Roll on this chart to see what technique tree, then roll d6 until you get a technique level you have access to. Then roll another dice in a similar method to determine what technique in that tier (something like a d10 should usually suffice).

Ex. I roll 12 and get Cataclysm. Then I roll d6 and get 6, but I'm only level 5 and don't have access to tier 6 techniques. I roll d6 again and get a 1. I roll d8 and get a 1, giving me access to the 5G technique.
