# üçÑ Shroomlette

The Shroomlette is the shroomkin god of happiness, rest and fertility. One of the few gods that exists in the realm of mortals. Her domain is a garden filled with all kinds of oddities that rests on the clouds above a mushroom forest. There she resides, forever resting in a shiny cradle, waiting to be tucked in by a visitor. The Garden is commonly used as a place of mediation since all forms of violence are forbidden within the domain of the Shroomlette.

The Shroomlette is an entity that represents the bond between gooms, a breed of squishy draconic creatures, and shroomkin, a race of people with close ties to fey creatures and mushrooms. These two entities live in tandem with each other with one main goal: increase the quantity of happiness in the world. The tactics they use to do so is to subdue creatures that decrease happiness and physically change the world around them to make it a better place to live.
