# üçÉ Mother Earth

Mother Earth is the god of all things untamed and natural. She is the oldest of all deities. It is said that she was the entity that created the realm of mortals. A piece of her exists inside of all living things. As such, she has no true domain. But there are locations where life is at its most dense that are considered sacred, like lush rain forests, coral reefs and the valleys between forested mountains.&#x20;

Many see Mother Earth as a benevolent force, but she is primarily an entity that seeks balance between sentient creatures and the rest of the world. Many great tragedies have happened to people in the past when mankind overstepped its boundaries: Floods, earthquakes and storms the likes of which the world is better off never seeing again. These stories and their lessons are passed down through those studying under the druidic arts so that way such tragedies can be prevented from happening again.

She is often depicted as a resting land mass, the bends of her shoulders, knees and hips creating mountains. While out and about, she is humanoid in shape, thought she appears to be entirely composed of lush green vegetation.
