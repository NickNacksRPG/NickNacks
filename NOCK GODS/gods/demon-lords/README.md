# ðŸ‘¿ Demon Lords

The entities that have the largest degree of influence over the Demon Realm. To say they rule over it would be giving them too much credit. The demon realm is a disgusting and dangerous twisted realm that is beyond control. The demon lords tend to spend a lot more time focused on the mortal realm, always looking to spread their influence among mortals willing to eat the forbidden fruit. In particular many spend a lot of time in their mortal forms to blend in and mingle with mortals, delivering their sales pitch directly to the ears of their would-be followers.

Demon lords are themselves demons, but they break the mold, bending the rules of what the typical demon can and can't do. They can transform other creatures into demons against their will, reproduce on their own, teleport long distances and create portals to other realms, among other things atypical of lesser fiends.
