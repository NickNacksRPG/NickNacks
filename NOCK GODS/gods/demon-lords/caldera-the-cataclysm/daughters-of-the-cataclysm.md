# Daughters of the Cataclysm

The Cataclysm is absolutely obsessed with raw physical strength, and constantly throws herself and her followers into situations where they can test their might. This manifests in a particularly strange way, where she sees herself as the perfect being, and so therefore her offspring are the only ones that really have a chance of every topping her feats of strength. The exact circumstances of their creation are unknown, but they typically end up as large muscular demons, and are always women.

Unfortunately for these ladies, mom's standards couldn't be higher: They must become stronger than their mother. Since all of them fall short of this goal, she abandons them, giving them some kind of leadership role in her demonic armies and only ever interacting with them sparingly. The only training she ever gives them is physical, so they are usually unprepared for this role.
