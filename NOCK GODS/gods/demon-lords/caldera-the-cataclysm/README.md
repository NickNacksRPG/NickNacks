# ðŸŒ‹ Caldera the Cataclysm

The Cataclysm is the most outwardly terrifying, hostile and destructive force known to mankind. She is concerned with little more than raw physical strength, twisting this ideology to its absolute extremes and eliminating any and all unable to survive the hostility and violence so common among her and her minions. As such, she is very often held in high regard by eugenicists, anarchists and the unhinged that just want to watch the world burn.

One of the few things that the followers of the Cataclysm will always hold in high regard is contests of raw physical strength. Their method of testing your might is typically an arm wrestling contest. This is often used as a last ditch effort by people to save their own skins when faced with overwhelming odds of death.

On rare occasions, her followers will kidnap specimens they deem worthy enough. They will be dragged into the demon realm to have all manner of alchemical, magical and genetic experiments run on them to create a creature that is _perfectly huge_.

Caldera herself is a massive muscular woman clad in metal armor who typically stands over 20 feet tall. Her body is covered in all manner of bony spikes, horns and scales. Along her back are dorsal plates that run down her massive tail, giving her stance a forward lean, allowing her to loom over and gaze upon lesser beings with her many eyes.
