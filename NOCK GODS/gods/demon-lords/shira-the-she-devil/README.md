# ðŸ‘„ Shira the She-Devil

Shira is the demon lord most known for making deals with mortals, and with subterfuge. A master of disguise, Shira always finds a way to hide amongst the crowd in parties held by those in the highest echelons of society. She will somehow simultaneously be the most beautiful and second most beautiful lady attending the party at once.&#x20;

She delights in the act of giving mortals exactly what they want, but then taking so much more in return. Her deals will always be carefully worded, often with a written contract. She may misrepresent things and lie to get people to sign, and if they believed her, its their fault for not reading the fine print. These devilish tendencies work to break down society by eroding trust, generating discontent and playing off of the selfish desires of mankind. You didn't honestly expect her help to be free, right dearest?

Shira prefers a much more appealing and innocuous form to represent herself. She takes on the form of a voluptuous fox-like beastfolk, appearing mostly human, save for the ears and tail. The only thing that would even indicate she is a demon is vertical pupils of her eyes. When in private company, she has a casual attire she likes involving loose purple clothes, and she lets all nine of her tails out. When working, such as attending parties, she tends to dress exceptionally well and hides all but one of her tails.

While at a social gathering, such as a party, festival, ball etc, you can exist in two places at once. This otherwise functions as a [ninja's shadow clone](https://app.gitbook.com/s/N6QDh7J4iyEozmJJtVa8/classes-1/rogue/ninja#id-1-shadow-clone-su-companion), but the clone disappears once the event ends or you begin combat.

So long as both clones aren't in someones line of sight at once, people do not question how you pop up so frequently.

<mark style="color:green;">T2: Mistrust</mark>\
You gain a new use to deception.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Sow Doubt</mark> - Roll a deception check after a few minutes of conversation (DC 10+creature's level). You can convince this creature that another creature has it out for them and seeks their downfall. They will always view what this creature does in the worst light possible, which can eventually cause great strife in the future.

This will stay the case until someone can use the [Detect Intrusive Presence](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/insight#detect-intrusive-presence-p) feature of insight (DC 10+your deception bonus). Usually someone only gets a check who is familiar that notices this unusual behavior.

For creatures who are close to one another, such as family, friends or allies, the DC increases. Usually only +2 for people they see in a positive light, +5 for allies and +10 for those closest to them.

<mark style="color:green;">T3: Devil's in the Details (Su)</mark>\
You gain the ability to write magically binding Fiendish Pacts.
