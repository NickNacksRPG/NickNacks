# Fiendish Pacts

A fiendish pact requires an agreement between two parties, typically via writing, but also can be done via verbal agreements. Such pacts bind the 2 creatures to these agreements, with immediate consequences if one does not abide by the agreement.

## <mark style="color:green;">Pact Basics</mark>

Pacts, like written contracts in real life, are methods of binding 2 parties together to persuade some time of cooperation or exchange. It usually involves exchanging goods, services, information or boons. Typically pacts are formed when someone desires something, but the other doesn't want to grant this desire for free. Both parties mediate until a satisfactory transaction is agreed upon. Then the 2 parties must decide on a <mark style="color:red;">punishment</mark> for the other should they not fulfill their end of the bargain. Again, the 2 parties come to an agreement on what the other desires. Finally, some type of gesture is taken to finalize the deal, such as shaking hands, returning a bow or signing a contract.

Some creatures may take issue with the order in which the parties perform their end of the bargain, but it is inevitably up to the creature with the power to make the pact what order things happen in.

## <mark style="color:green;">Legally Binding</mark>&#x20;

Pacts, unlike written contracts in real life, cannot be broken without evading consequence. Pacts are made with magic that does not ask for mediation or a jury. Disobeying the contract immediately afflicts the creature with whatever the <mark style="color:red;">punishment</mark> is. Any kind of agreement must be within the means of the creature to perform.&#x20;

In the event where someone is unable to hold up their end of the bargain, or does so in a way that is not in accordance with the deal, they are afflicted with <mark style="color:red;">punishment</mark> immediately. You cannot also say "I will grant you anything you wish" without the ability to grant wishes.&#x20;

Punishments must also be within the means of both parties. You cannot just say "if you don't pet this dog 10 times then you burst into flames and die" without being able to use some type of fire magic. If you agree on a <mark style="color:red;">punishment</mark> that you cannot inflict, then there is no consequence for not fulfilling their end of the bargain. It us up to you to decide if the other really CAN devour your eternal soul or not.

## <mark style="color:green;">Shira's Boons</mark>&#x20;

Shira, and her most dedicated, are capable of providing additional boons to those they make pacts with. Contracts without meaning, such as those made between allies to acquire more boons, will draw Shira's ire and are not recommended.

<mark style="color:green;">Lexicon</mark> - Give creature information about a subject as though asking Shira herself. The amount of information she gives typically depends on what was done in the contract. Good deeds get the bare minimum to satisfy the contract while deeds that align with Shira's interest are paid in dividends.
