# üëÅÔ∏è Moogen

Moogen is the demon lord most often associated with death, darkness and murder. The forces of the Cataclysm will come busting down your door. Moogen's forces will watch you for days, waiting for when your death will have the most impact in inspiring fear and chaos in your family, town or society as a whole. The more impact the death has, the flashier it is and the longer it stains the memory of mortals, the better.

Moogen's unique obsession with death has created a unique set of circumstances. Moogen is not a singular entity, but rather a position that can be taken by someone capable of outwitting, outmaneuvering and killing the current Moogen. Moogen delights in the constant dance of death that happens all around her as a result of the tasty allure of this lucrative opportunity.

Because Moogen is more of a title, rather than a singular creature, the appearance can vary greatly, but a handful of features are passed down. Moogen always has the same type of white eyes with many circles within that seem to spiral and hypnotize. They always have enormous mouths capable of snapping open and devouring a creature of equal size whole. When undercover, the mouth in excess is covered in skin, but usually it is only partly covered in skin, making it appear as though Moogen has multiple mouths.
