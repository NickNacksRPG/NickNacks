# üôè Invoking Deities

Deities can give their favor in specific ways, but invoking their name can give you a more general boon. Whenever you would perform a task that falls in line with the god's ethos, goals or tenets, you can choose to invoke their name as a free action.&#x20;

This could mean a contest of strength for The Cataclysm, a persuasion check made against a fiend for Brazzeria, or a survival check to track down a hunter exterminating wildlife for Mother Earth. The DM is the final arbiter to decide if your request is answered. When you invoke a deity, you expend a use of prayer and gain a d8 to any single d20 roll (minus something like a random chart).

If you invoke and your deity disapproves, you lose that use of prayer, and you get an impression of why your request for aid failed.&#x20;

You can only invoke a deity that you have curried favor for in most circumstances. When you invoke, you cannot do so again for 1 minute.
