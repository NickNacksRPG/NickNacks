imaginations of those involved are grounded in and informed by the underlying mathematics and mechanics. Just like in the real world, math is the basis on which everything exists - change one variable, and the world and the cultures within will look much different. Despite this foundational importance, the math in TTRPGs is often neglected or not taken into consideration during its creation, causing the stories built on it to lack plausibility or the players to engage in degenerate gameplay loops that are better incentivized by the math. We must elevate the standards of game balance and mathematical principles within to ensure a stable play environment with maximal freedom of storytelling.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For the purpose of this discussion, I'll mostly be referring to the design of Dungeons and Dragons, but these principles extend to all games, TTRPG or otherwise.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="The Value of Balance and Mathematics" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Value_of_Balance_and_Mathematics_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>The Value of Balance and Mathematics</h2></div><div class="el-h3"><h3 data-heading="1.

The Foundation of the Universe</h3></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Here in the real world, our actions are most often decided by their expected outcomes. People grow the food that produces the most in the local terrain, they wear protection to avoid death, they take the path of least resistance, they outlaw actions that harm others. If the outcomes or goals were different, the actions taken would be different - if stabbing someone was a pleasant experience that extended their lifespan, then the laws around stabbing people would be very different. If we only ate for pleasure, we would grow what tasted the best regardless of climate.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is true down to the very foundations of the universe, where the actions that the atoms and forces of the universe take are decided by simple rules. Light takes the path of least time, mass and energy act towards increased entropy, and other such rules determine how everything else acts.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Just like in real life, expected outcomes are what guide us in TTRPGs. If the goal of the player is to live the longest and kill the most things, then the actions they take will be guided by what best gets them to that goal. Because this is based on probability, it becomes a question of simple math to determine the best course of action at a given moment. All else the same, the weapon that does the most damage should be what everybody in the world defaults to. All else the same, the strategy that prevents the most damage taken is the best.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Math IS worldbuilding.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-h3"><h3 data-heading="2.

The Foundation of Game Design</h3></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In real life, we can't fight against monsters and men-at-arms with shuriken and our bare fists. Reality dictates that those actions would likely result in our demise. However, in a game, we often find ourselves roleplaying something that isn't exactly realistic - such as a magician slinging fireballs at ogres. If we want to allow the full range of themes to be represented in a game, we need all of them to be on a fair playing field. There is no purpose to allowing "Unarmed Strike" as an action that accomplishes nothing and gets you killed, after all - but we decide the rules of this universe. We can make "Unarmed Strike" deal substantial damage, or have additional benefits that make their use reasonable. By setting the rules properly, what is feasible changes to match our desires.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Whether what you desire is a good thing is a discussion for another day - let's focus on the hows.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What players do is a combination of what they desire, and what the game rewards. Developers should set the rules to reward what they want to happen, and not reward what they don't. Ideally, the incentives should match what the players want to do.</p></div><div class="el-h3"><h3 data-heading="3. The Foundations of Fairness and Creativity" dir="auto" class="heading" id="3._The_Foundations_of_Fairness_and_Creativity_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>3. The Foundations of Fairness and Creativity</h3></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The incentive structure of a game like DnD usually comes in the form of power. More money and experience means bigger and more magical swords and fireballs, or more hirelings, etcetera. When you want a fair game for players to enjoy various themes and strategies, you must balance the power such that there is not a single overwhelmingly dominant strategy that is easily recognized by players. This is only fair; if you have multiple players, and one is given obviously inferior power, they may experience frustration or disengagement when they notice their impact on the game is insubstantial as a result.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Fairness in a system of mathematics is fundamentally a question of mathematics.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When the underlying math is neglected, and the rest of the game is built despite it, you will quickly find oddities. If you make "Unarmed Strike" deal 1 damage, and "Longsword" deal between 1 and 8, you should not be surprised when nobody will opt for "Unarmed Strike" under any circumstances. If there is a dominant strategy, and yet you still declare that most of the people in this world fight with fists instead of swords (all else equal), your world becomes less believable. From the math, the rest of the world-building should come naturally and without significant leaps of logic - If you declare something exists in this world, there should be a basis for it, and this basis almost always comes from the math.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Balanced systems inherently foster deeper engagement. Players are more likely to invest their time into the mechanics of a game when they believe they will not be held back by deviating from superior strategies. By employing mathematical approaches to skill scaling, damage output, resource allocation, and character progression, players are free to choose options based on thematics, creativity, and their own desires without worrying about doing the math on behalf of the developers to make sure they are being dealt a fair hand.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Everything I've stated so far may seem obvious, and even patronizing, but the reality is that most developers do not take this into consideration as much as they should.</p></div><div class="el-h3"><h3 data-heading="4. The Willy Wonka World of DnD" dir="auto" class="heading" id="4._The_Willy_Wonka_World_of_DnD_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>4. The Willy Wonka World of DnD</h3></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I'll spare you the fine details and skip to the important math to keep in mind.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In DnD, there are listed weapons that are assumed to be available from character creation. If we consider the world in which this takes place, it would be fair to assume that the people in the world would also want to survive encounters when selecting their weaponry, and those weapons are boiled down to sets of numbers and tags to describe them. The most important number to a commoner with no bonuses to anything is the damage number - in a fight, the odds to succeed are highest by simply using the weapon with the highest damage. And yet, a dagger deals 2.5 damage, while a stick deals 3.5. If they use a very big stick, they can even reach 4.5, if they don't mind using both hands. If they spend some more money and actions, they can use two axes for a whopping 7 damage, and this is only with "simple" weapons they may be proficient in.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The simple conclusion here is that, all else equal, a commoner's preferred weapon should be a stick, or two axes if they have money to spare. The stick is the most versatile, cheap, and powerful weapon available to them. Even if you take into account the bonuses from stats, a commoner would need maximum dexterity to consider a dagger, even compared to weapons they are not proficient in. In this world, using a dagger is mathematically inferior to every other option for any regular, non-player character.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This results in a silly world that only suits the players, without taking into account the rest of the creatures. Why would a knife be a substantially worse weapon than a stick?&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A goat that attacks a human is likely to kill them in a single attack. How long would a farmer last in such a world?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Some classes and builds can easily survive far longer and deal multiple times as much damage as others, often while being better at non-combat activities as well. Why would anyone willingly choose to be the inferior class if the objective is to survive?&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The expected earnings of a player far outpace the earnings of commoners, as untrained labor is only enough to pay for a gallon of ale or a stay at a poor inn while a single piece of basic equipment can be worth a hundred times as much. Is it really acceptable to put the price on a day of deadly work (such as a mercenary) equal to the price of a dagger, one of the worst items in the game, such that a player could hire dozens of them for every adventure?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">How long can you ride on a player's goodwill and desire for thematics and roleplay before these poor worldbuilding decisions start to interfere with their fantasy?</p></div><div class="el-h3"><h3 data-heading="The Defense of Flawed Mathematics" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Defense_of_Flawed_Mathematics_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>The Defense of Flawed Mathematics</h3></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One of the most insidious phenomena in the world of TTRPGs is the tendency of players to defend poor mathematics and imbalanced mechanics, often born out of a fundamental misunderstanding or intentional ignorance of underlying principles. This defense frequently stems from a place of trust in the developers and an emotional attachment to the game itself, leading players to uphold the perceived authority of the creators.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="1.

They clearly left it like that for a reason."  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Why don't you do better, then?"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When players encounter a system that is hailed as "official," there is a natural inclination to assume that the developers have meticulously crafted every detail, and thus, their choices are unquestionable. Players may erroneously believe that since the developers designed the game, they must have considered every possible variable and outcome, rendering any criticism unwarranted.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Players may also propagate the myth of developer infallibility, asserting that they are privy to unique insights that justify design decisions. Such attitudes not only inhibit constructive discourse, but they also diminish the validity of collective player experiences and insights, as an entire community’s lived experiences may be rendered irrelevant in the face of perceived expertise. The belief that there "can’t be a better way" is a common claim that started among video game developers, such as at Riot Games and Nexon, as they frequently cite data they claim exists to justify their actions while refusing to release said data to prove it. The truth is that no such data exists, and modern gaming communities can easily get access to or create superior data from which to make decisions.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When confronted with suggestions for rebalance, players often leap to the defense of their cherished mechanics, positing that the developers "must have had a reason" for their choices. This blind and aggressive defense of the systems further perpetuates the cycle of flawed designs, as those advocating for improvement or merely offering their observations are dismissed as "Powergamers," or told that they're just not focusing on what matters, and that roleplay trumps game design.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because the foundation of these defenses is inherently fallacious, they almost always lead to a statement that reveals their lack of engagement with the topic. The most common ones include that the game is made to be changed from table to table, that the suggestions are merely opinions and do not represent the needs of the community, that the opinions of those that are not part of successful gaming companies are inherently worthless, and basic attacks on the character of those criticizing the game (rather than focusing on the criticisms themselves).</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="2.

Ignorance of Mathematical Foundations</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Most players lack the mathematical literacy necessary to fully grasp the implications of game mechanics at a detailed level. Consequently, when flaws in balance emerge—be they overpowered abilities, inefficient resource distribution, or underwhelming options—players may misinterpret these issues as subjective preferences rather than objective mathematical failings.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The most common misinterpretation of the math is that of percentage reductions: Most players do not know that reducing an effect by 100% is far more than twice as good as reducing it by 50%. A common way this ignorance appears is in video games such as League of Legends, Minecraft, and Skyrim, where players will honestly believe that combining a reduction of 50% with another 50% and getting a result of 75% is somehow a "diminished" effect because the total did not reach 100%, when in reality the result is a multiplicative, mathematically accurate, and fair way to represent the effect.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Combined with the aforementioned bias towards that which is "official," a majority of the population will convince themselves that their intuitive (incorrect) understanding of the underlying mathematics is also aligned with what the developers think - and, unfortunately, they may be correct.</p></div><div class="el-h4"><h4 data-heading="3.

Ignorance of the Developers</h4></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The methods used by the developers of DnD to create the game and the underlying math is transparently dubious. By their own (unwitting) admission, the top-down approaches used by them with a lack of emphasis on mechanics and math, insufficient player testing, and dismissal of community feedback has led to books full of wondrous descriptions of a game that does not accurately match their vision in practice.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The examples of such are too numerous to list, but to bring up simultaneous examples that perfectly encapsulate the sheer nescience of the lead developers of DnD, we can look at the playtests of DnD 5.5. During the playtests, the developers made a particularly bizarre public video about the results, falsely claiming that a mechanic that players did not interact with was "mathematically one of the most powerful" when it was the worst on average, dismissing feedback because player scores on individual features were higher than the overall score, and even incorrectly referencing their own changes to their own content.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What truly happened behind the scenes to cause such a public statement to be made without any proofreading is unclear. It's up to a given individual to review these actions to decide whether it's negligence, ignorance, or deliberate equivocation. I try taking the most charitable approach by assigning ignorance to what could have just as easily been malice.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="From Math, All Is Born" dir="auto" class="heading" id="From_Math,_All_Is_Born_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>From Math, All Is Born</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Game developers must adopt a mathematical mindset in their approach. This includes rigorous playtesting with statistical analyses, iterative balancing, and a commitment to utilizing clear metrics for evaluating the effectiveness and fairness of mechanics while maintaining consistency and logic. Checking published content for faults should not be the burden of the players, especially when the product is advertised as being beginner-friendly. Disparities that can be encountered within a new player's first turn should not be tolerated, let alone upheld as intended design.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Players should be involved in the balancing process, and even perceived faults in criticism should be thoroughly investigated to identify the underlying reasons for the criticisms being put forth. When a community is particularly large, there's a high likelihood that there will be individuals that practically design the game in its entirety in their criticisms. To dismiss them is the peak of hubris.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When a game's fundamentals and mathematical foundations are made airtight, the content built on them will likewise be untouchable. Under ideal circumstances, even inexperienced players should be able to expand on the content in the game with little worry of diminishing the balance. I hope to one day live in a world where criticisms of game balance and mathematics are truly in the realm of the nitpicking and biased, and that all game discussion becomes that of themes and abstractions.</p></div><div class="footer"><div class="data-bar"></div></div></div></div></div><div id="right-content" class="leaf" style="--sidebar-width: var(--sidebar-width-right);"><div id="right-sidebar" class="sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"><label class="theme-toggle-container" for="theme-toggle-input" id=""><input class="theme-toggle-input" type="checkbox" id="theme-toggle-input"><div class="toggle-background"></div></label></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content-wrapper"><div id="right-sidebar-content" class="leaf-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="feature-header"><div class="feature-title">Interactive Graph</div></div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
