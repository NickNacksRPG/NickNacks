# ðŸ˜± But Who is the Game Master?!

Out of everybody in the group, the game master, or GM, is the one who is undoubtedly going to be putting the most effort into the game. It can often feel like a bit of a drawing straws scenario where someone has to put up with the extra work so everybody can enjoy a game. Chances are if you are introducing a new game to your friends, you're going to be the one to run the game since you "know the rules" or whatever excuse your buddies come up with.

I'm here to tell you you need not fret: Becoming a GM is easy! It's becoming a great GM that's hard. I'll give you a few hints and shortcuts that can make preparing a game from scratch, potentially even for the first time, much easier.

Chances are if you're playing this game, you love RPG games, anime, fantasy or all the above. You can steal all kinds of things from your previous experiences. You can steal characters, history, maybe even an entire world from your favorite media. Nintendo isn't going to sue you if you make your exploration game based off of Breath of the Wild. What they won't know won't hurt them.

This is not financial advice. No but seriously. I'm still assuming a bit here, but I'm guessing you use something like twitter or YouTube for entertainment. Maybe you're even the artsy type and you browse Deviant Art or Pinterest...Though those places have become AI cesspools...Anyway, you're going to want to fill your worlds with people, places and things! Find pictures and videos that inspire you. Being inspired by something is your creative brain salivating at the idea of making it your own. Whether you find pictures of old ruins you want your players to explore, an awesome monster you want them to fight, or NPCs to fill your towns with, you need these things to make the world feel great. Maybe you can even commission someone if you're feeling generous and need something specific. I learned how to draw just to make pictures of my characters!

Just recently I decided I wanted to include a maze in my game. I have done mazes before, but they were pretty small and included a map. This made it so players could just see where they have been from me getting rid of the fog of war and made it feel like a process of elimination. But what do you do when things are more complicated? What if the maze is too big for a map? What if the maze changes?

I wanted to try out something new to get a better maze feel. So I looked up how other people have done their labyrinth sessions. I decided to do something a bit more abstract where things the party found gave them clues and eventually when they gathered enough clues, they found their way through. Not exactly the true misery intended from a labyrinth, but we are trying to have fun after all. I wouldn't have had the idea if others hadn't tried it before me and posted their experience online. Maybe the weird stuff you want to do in your game you can learn from someone else's mistakes too!
