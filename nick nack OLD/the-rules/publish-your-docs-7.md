# \[Tags]

Tags are descriptors that let you apply general rules to similar effects. Tags are not just limited to spells, but spells do commonly use tags. Tags are always denoted with \[brackets]. Certain tags may only effect specific parts of a spell.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Buff" %}
An effect with the buff tag grants a boon to a creature. A creature can only have one effect with the buff tag affecting them at once. If an unwilling creature has a buff used on it, it can choose to deny it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Sometimes when you want dramatic moments, you have to stop and chat with the big bad or make some heroic speech. During such times, buffs do not time out. Let the scene play out instead of RUSH HIM DOWN BEFORE MY BUFF RUNS OUT.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Bond" %}
Bonds are interpersonal effects that bond you to another creature in some way. They are types of lesser buffs often favoring functionality over power. They do not take your buff slot. Can be denied automatically just like a buff spell.

You can have an unlimited number of bond effects on you.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Contingent" %}
The effect can be used ahead of time with a specific trigger for when it activates. A creature can only have a single contingent effect active on them at once. The effect manifests as a clearly visible wisp of energy with a question mark on it that floats around the creature  The DC to identify the effect increases by 5.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Concentration" %}
An effect with the concentration tag requires some degree of upkeep from the caster and typically has a duration. You can only have one concentration effect active at once. Concentration effects end if the caster is defeated, fascinated, stunned, put to sleep or otherwise completely prevented from taking any actions. You can also cease concentration as an instant action if desired.

If you cast a spell with concentration, you must hold the staff in order to maintain your concentration.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Companion" %}
If a spell has the companion tag, it summons an ally, or otherwise serves some kind of interpersonal function. You can only have 2 companions, or 1 if you have negative charisma.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Charm" %}
Charm effects allow the creature inflicting it to exert some degree of control over others. All charm effects are also \[mind-affecting].
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Curse" %}
Curse effects inflict permanent debilitating conditions on creatures. Curses cannot be dispelled, but they all have some way to get rid of them, usually requiring some convoluted thing most wouldn't normally do unless prompted.\
Can be identified using the "identify curse or affliction" feature in the medicine skill.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Dmg Type" %}
Effects that deal damage have a tag that tells you what damage type it does, with the following types...\
\[Force], \[Zap], \[Frost], \[Fire], \[Poison], \[Sonic], \[Psychic], \[Holy], \[Necrotic]

If a effect deals multiple damage types it lists all of them.  If you can choose between different types then it gets the appropriate tag when you choose a specific element.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Darkness" %}
Effects with the darkness tag either create darkness, or have special interactions when in it.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Dismissable" %}
Dismissable effects can be ended prematurely by the caster as a standard action.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Elemental" %}
Elemental effects manipulate elements that don’t necessarily have damage types associate with them.

Elemental effects can have the \[air], \[earth] and \[water] tags.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Elusive" %}
Actions/movement ignore the usual rules for AoOs and do not provoke any AoOs. Frequently appears in subsections of abilities.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Fear" %}
Usually inflicts shaken or frightened. All fear effects are also \[mind-affecting].
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Figment" %}
Figments create creatures and terrain that don’t truly exist. As long as the creature does not directly interact with a figment, it believes it to be real. If a creature figures out that it's fake and tells its allies, or demonstrates by walking through it, they no longer believe it to be real. Directly interacting requires doing things like walking into a wall or attacking a creature, upon which the creature makes a will save. A failure indicates the creature will try to run around an obstacle or that they missed a creature.

If used to satisfy the conditions of a surrender (such as making a spooky monster). The creatures affected get a will save to negate it. They have advantage on this save if they saw you cast the spell.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Glamer" %}
A glamer changes a subject’s sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or nothing at all.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Healing" %}
This effect heals hp, gives temp hp, or gets rid of debilitating status effects.\
\[Healing] effects cannot bring creatures above 75% hp. Healing in excess of 75% hp is converted to [temp hp](publish-your-docs-2/temp-hp-healing.md).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Light" %}
Effects with the light tag either create light, or have special interactions when in it.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Language" %}
Language effects require the target to understand your spoken words, or requires some form of clear communication that mimics language (like telepathy).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mana Burn" %}
Abilities with the tag \[mana burn] either reduce your max mana, or have an optional more powerful use case that reduces your max mana. Reduces by 1 unless stated otherwise. Usually goes away on rest. If an ability does not mention a mana cost, then it still reduces current and max mana by 1 if it has the mana burn tag.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Mind-Affecting" %}
Mind affecting effects are a more general group that include things like fear effects, charms and more. \
Creatures that are mindless (that do not possess an intelligence score) cannot be affected by mind-affecting effects.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Martial" %}
Martial effects allow the user to deliver the effect using the attack and damage and on-hit effects of a wielded weapon, even if it mentions using another form of attack.&#x20;

Special attacks by default ALWAYS have the martial tag. It is not listed to save time/space.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Overheal" %}
This healing effect is particularly powerful. When healing from an overheal effect exceeds the targets maximum hp, the remainder is converted into temp hp.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Pattern" %}
Like a figment, a pattern creates an image that others can see, but a pattern also affects the minds of those who see it or are caught in it. Common effects include fascination or blurred vision.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Polymorph" %}
Polymorph effects transform creatures into other creatures.  Many of the features granted from polymorph effects are based off the Shapeshifter's class features.  You retain the ability to speak while polymorphed. When transforming using a polymorph effect, it can fall under one of a the following categories to determine the nature of your transformation (some can be multiple).&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Chimeric Shape</mark> - Your form stays roughly the same, but acquires some features of the new creature that you're transforming into, such as claws, fur, a long tongue etc. When you chimeric shape, you do not lose access to any of your gear.

<mark style="color:green;">True Polymorph</mark> - Your form completely changes to the form mentioned in the ability. You completely lose access to all of your equipment, but can still speak. There are only be a handful of features recognizable from your previous self, such as eye color.

<mark style="color:green;">Baleful Polymorph</mark> - This form of polymorph is inflicted upon you rather than willingly used. It functions very similarly to true polymorph, but provides fewer tangible benefits and includes debuffs. You do lose access to your equipment and cannot speak.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Persistent" %}
This effect creates something that has an initial effect and an effect that persists over time.  This type of effect has a cooldown on its damage. This cooldown is until the end of an affected creatures turn.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Recharge" %}
This effect has a cooldown, or some kind of specific mechanic to use repeatedly. If no cooldown is listed, then it is assumed to be only be usable 1/day.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Subtle" %}
The effect has a chance for nobody to notice it. If the target creature fails its save, then the effect goes unnoticed. The DC to identify a spell with the subtle tag increases by 5.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Scrying" %}
Scrying effects create a specific type of magic sensor that allow you to perceive the world through another creature's eyes and ears. Typically it requires a standard action to swap between you and the creature's perspective

While you focus through another creature, you use all of the creature's senses, but your own perception bonus. You are also stunned. Taking any damage causes you to snap back to your body and stuns you for an additional turn..&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sigil" %}
The effect puts magical text on a surface with some kind of delayed effect, usually triggering when a creature walks within a certain radius of the sigil. A sigil must be clearly visible in order to function. If it is obscured, then it is deactivated until it is unobscured. Most sigils have the ability to apply a passphrase that when spoken aloud, allows a user to move through the area without triggering the sigil.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Teleportation" %}
Teleportation effects allow the user and their allies to use the astral plane as a shortcut to get to places far away. Teleportation tends to be very limited in scope, bringing you to very specific predetermined places or being wildly off course if not. Unless otherwise stated, you must have line of sight to the location you are teleporting to.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Upcast" %}
By spending more mana, you can increase the effectiveness of the spell. The degree to which varies by spell.\
In order to upcast a spell, you must meet a certain level requirement in addition to increasing the mana cost. For example Imagination (Moogen 1) has an options up to upcast 5, effectively making that option a level 5 technique, requiring you to be level 9 to use it.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
