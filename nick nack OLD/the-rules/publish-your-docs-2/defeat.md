# ⚰️ Defeat

When you take damage that reduces you to zero or lower, you are defeated, and must be healed to regain consciousness in a timely manner.

You can choose to non-lethally defeat someone provided you are using a manufactured weapon, unarmed strike or natural attack. If this is not the case, they must make a DC 8 luck check or die. Creatures that manage to survive being defeated have to keep making this luck check every time they take damage while defeated.

When a [main character](https://app.gitbook.com/s/N6QDh7J4iyEozmJJtVa8/quick-character-creation-guide/main-character-status) (ie usually the players) falls to zero HP, they can take no actions on their turn and can only crawl at 15 speed (they have the defeated condition). When a character recovers from the defeated condition, their next turn they are dazed. When you are defeated or when you take damage while defeated, you receive 1 stack of drain.

When recovering from the defeated condition, you also gain an [affliction](https://app.gitbook.com/s/EuW2xQOuMIcaalg1YNV3/afflictions). More rules on those in the afflictions section.

Main characters also don't run the risk of dying when defeated. Instead of rolling luck checks, a main character gets a stack of doom when they take damage while defeated. Upon acquiring the 5th stack, they die. Doom stacks are lost on rest.
