# Temp HP/Healing

In general healing is accessible, with the [jizzle physick](https://nick-nacks-rpg.gitbook.io/nicknacksrpg.com/equipment/equipment/jizzle-physicks) being a primary component to the game. Allowing you to _theoretically_ fight on forever. Effects with the \[overheal] tag grant temp hp equal to excess healing past your maximum.

In the absence of danger, a defeated creature will regain 1 hp after 1 hour.  They are staggered until they are healed or they rest.

With a proper 8 hours rest, a character restores all their HP, all of their daily use abilities and recover mana burn. You can only rest once each day.
