# 🏳️ Surrender/Morale

During combat there come times when you do not wish to fight, usually when one side is close to victory, but can also happen when creatures are clearly outnumbered or outmatched.

How well a surrender feels in a situation usually comes down to a gut feeling, affected by a lot of variables. In order to even consider a surrender to be viable, one or more of the following (or other applicable) conditions should be met…

\>Numbers advantage\
\>Some other clear advantage, such as terrain, positioning, equipment or a powerful noteworthy ally\
\>Heavily damaged or unconscious allies\
\>Consequences for not surrendering (often death or further prosecution)\
\>Hostages\
\>Whether or not creatures are minions or named characters

A surrender requires clear communication, which may not always be possible given the hectic and spread out nature of battle. Some creatures, particularly mindless ones, will not surrender unless specific circumstances are met. Creatures of animal intelligence can be convinced to surrender if you can speak to animals or have wild empathy etc.

Surrender can mean forfeiting weapons, fleeing in fear, begging for mercy or something similar.
