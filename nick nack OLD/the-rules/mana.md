# ðŸ’Ž Mana

Mana is the universal resource used for techniques, and is also used for many other things such as class features and magic items. Techniques is an umbrella term for special moves given to martials and mages alike.

In order to use a technique, you must spend mana equal to the tier of technique. Cantrips have an effective tier of 0 and do not cost mana. While not in immediate danger (such as combat or a chase), you regenerate 1 mana per turn, or 10 mana per minute.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark></summary>

By spending more mana, you can increase the effectiveness of abilities with the \[upcast] tag. The degree to which varies by ability. Just because you have enough mana in your pool does not mean you can upcast an ability.

In order to upcast, you must meet a certain level requirement (see mana basics above) in addition to increasing the mana cost. For example [Imagination](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-1/imagination) has options up to upcast 5, effectively making that option a level 5 technique, requiring you to be level 9 to use it.&#x20;

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Mana Reserves</mark></summary>

Mana reserves function exactly like your base mana, except they disappear after used, and only regenerate after you rest. Mana reserves are gained through having positive intelligence, are sometimes given to mage classes and through magic items, often with particular restrictions on their use.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Mana Burn</mark></summary>

Abilities with the tag \[mana burn] either reduce your max mana, or have an optional more powerful use case that reduces your max mana. Reduces by 1 unless stated otherwise.  Usually goes away on rest. If an ability does not mention a mana cost, then it still reduces current and max mana by 1 if it has the mana burn tag.
