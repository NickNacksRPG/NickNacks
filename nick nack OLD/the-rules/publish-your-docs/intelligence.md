A creature is considered sentient if it has at least -2 intelligence. These creatures typically do not speak, but can understand at least 1 language. Most magical beasts fall in this category.

Animal intelligence is -3 intelligence. Creatures with animal intelligence only understand simple commands (if anything). They are usually limited to their instinctual urges.

Mindless creatures possess no will of their own. They act completely on instinct.
