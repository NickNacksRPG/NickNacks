Your faith, ability to resist mental influence and notice things in the world are what characterizes wisdom.

* You add your wisdom to will save
* You add your wisdom to perception, the skill all creatures get for free
* You can pray to your god for guidance (see below for details). You can use prayer a number of times per day equal to your wisdom bonus
* Positive wisdom automatically puts you into T1 favor in one [god](https://app.gitbook.com/o/EKVEWQG0W87J8YCOQDO5/s/qFzTamwcoNEgFoEbLz7c/). 1k GBP per point
* Characters with positive wisdom multiply GBP gains by (1+wis)\

Prayer requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration.

You get a number of uses of prayer equal to (wisdom+tier of favor). Because positive wisdom grants T1 favor in a god, you usually start with wis+1 uses of prayer.

You gain impressions from the future about something in specific. When you initially start praying, you must mention a specific action (attack the bandits, pet the dog etc.). When the prayer is complete, gain a nugget information about whether this action will bring favorable or unfavorable results to within the next half hour. The answer does not take into account consequences into the future past 30 minutes.
