<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Companions</mark></summary>

In media it's very common for creatures to have minions, squires and sidekicks. This is what the companion system is for. Like most other content, the companion system is ill-suited for large quantities of creatures, like armies. Its meant to be more compact. Something to take with you on the go for your adventure. This could also reasonably extend to temporary lesser allies that join your party.

Companions are generally tied to your class, abilities and items. Any such ability is marked with the \[companion] tag.

* You are limited to 2 companion slots
* Companions always act on your turn if you are present. There is no separation between your turns, you all act in the same initiative.
* Companions gain a bonus or penalty to attack based off of your charisma

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Contacts</mark></summary>

A contact is a friend from the past. A creature (so not necessarily humanoid) that can either be relied on to come to you when needed, or to always stay in one place. Contacts are always specialized in one particular task, such as tracking, making weapons, or running an inn.

A contact doesn't always offer you free services, but they are typically willing to give you better services, drop other clients to assist you and in general try their best to keep you "in the loop."&#x20;

Depending on the nature of your game, all contacts might be wanderers, or they might all reside in a handful of settlements you frequent.

With positive charisma, you gain a teamwork feat. You can share a single teamwork feat you possess with a number of creatures equal to your charisma bonus. In order to share a teamwork feat, you need to perform training exercises for 1 hour with the creatures you intend to team up with.&#x20;
