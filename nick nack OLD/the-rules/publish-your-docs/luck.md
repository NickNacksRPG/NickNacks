When playing table top, a lot of things aren't well defined until they get into render distance, which basically means when players ask about it. When a situation pops up where your player asks for a specific circumstance like "Is the door to the armory locked?" "is there a hat store in town?" or "are there any footholds on the side of this cliff?" and you don't immediately have a response, the character in question rolls a luck check. If it's a general party question, or if you bring your lucky friend with you during your shopping trip, they could reasonably roll it instead.

*   Examples

    | Likelihood (of being favorable) | DC | Description                                     |
    | ------------------------------- | -- | ----------------------------------------------- |
    | Likely                          | 5  | "Are there footholds on the side of this cliff" |
    | Plausible                       | 10 | "Is there a hat store in town?"                 |
    | Unlikely                        | 15 | "Is the door to this person's house locked?"    |
    | Very Unlikely                   | 20 | "Any human meat for sale?"                      |
    | Usually Impossible              | 25 | "There any lava pools in this forest?"          |

Again, if you already had an answer in mind, don't roll this.\
This is something that you should use in moderation. The moment you let your players start rolling this again and again is when all cohesion in your world evaporates
