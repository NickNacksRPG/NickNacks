<summary><mark style="color:green;">Strength Basics</mark></summary>

Lifting capacity, the ability to swing heavy weapons and wear heavy armors, fortitude and athletics are what characterize strength.

* You add your strength to fortitude saves
* You add your strength to [poise](../publish-your-docs-5/)
* Every point of strength increases your carry weight by 100 (see below for more details)
* Every point of strength increases your jump distance by 5 ft with the [jump](../publish-your-docs-4/publish-your-docs.md#jump) action\


- Negative strength subtracts from your fortitude saves
- Every negative point of strength halves your carry weight

A creature can lift and drag twice as much as their carry weight, but is staggered while doing so.
