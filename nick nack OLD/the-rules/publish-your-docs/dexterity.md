# Dexterity

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Dexterity Basics</mark></summary>

Agility, sneakiness and how good you are with your hands are what characterize dexterity

* Depending on your choice in armor, you can add your dexterity to your AC, but you always add it to [poise](../publish-your-docs-5/)
* You add dexterity to attack/dmg with ranged weapons and light weapons (but not at the same time as strength)

- You add dexterity to your reflex save\


* Negative dexterity (usually) subtracts from these values
