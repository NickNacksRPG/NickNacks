# Cloning Devices

You start off your adventures waking up in some alchemist's lab, surrounded in copies of yourself. Whenever you die, there is a fresh body waiting for you back at the lab that your soul gets sucked into.

This plays more into having a secret base type thing, and it feels a little less metagame-y than "chosen by god." it also has an interesting mystery component to it. Why were you guys chosen as clones? Whose lab is this? How's that for storytelling with resurrection?
