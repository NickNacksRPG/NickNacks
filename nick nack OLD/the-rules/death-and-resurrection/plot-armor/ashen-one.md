# Ashen One

In dark souls, certain types of creatures, namely the player character, hold a special place in the world's lore. When you die you don't reload the game, you canonically respawn at the location you last rested, leaving behind all your money where you died.

You could choose to adopt a similar system where certain types of conditions need to be met for these unique creatures to die for real. Having the characters lose all their money might not be the best approach for a TTRPG: players like their money. But in souls games you can go back to the place you died and collect the money again so maybe.

This kind of natural respawn mechanic is a good fit for campaigns where you expect your players to encounter dangerous creatures on the regular and your players don't get too discouraged from losing. Meat grinder without the consequences of losing your character for good.
