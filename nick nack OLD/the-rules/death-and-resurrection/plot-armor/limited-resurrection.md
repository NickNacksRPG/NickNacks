# Limited Resurrection

Pose a caveat to resurrection magic that imposes a severely limiting factor, such as only being able to revive a creature shortly after it died with some kind of resource attached to it. Maybe even make it a limited resource by tying it to physical items, like scrolls with this effect attached to it.&#x20;
