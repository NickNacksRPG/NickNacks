# Saving Throws

Saving throws decide the effectiveness of abilities that do not require attack rolls. Typically it is the affected creature that rolls the save. In order to consider a saving throw a "pass," the affected creature must meet a number determined by the creature using the ability. This number is called a DC (difficulty class).&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Saves come in 3 forms:</mark>&#x20;

Fort saves (based on strength)

Reflex saves (based on dexterity)&#x20;

Will saves (based on wisdom)
