# Size and Reach

This game is meant to be played on a grid of hexes or squares. Personally I prefer hexes. Creatures must be represented in such a space. That's why creatures are broken up into size categories. See picture below chart for references. Size comes with a handful of other features as well.

Creatures threaten all spaces they occupy by default.

You can enter the space of a creature that is a size category larger or smaller than you. If you leave a space occupied by a creature, it provokes an AoO as though you were leaving a threatened area. If you get attacked this way, the same creature can't also AoO you for leaving their threatened square in the same turn.
