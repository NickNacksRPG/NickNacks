*   Cover is an environmental condition that increases your AC and reflex saves by an amount dependent on how much it protects you.

    | ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Cover       | +2 AC and reflex            | A chest-high wall or a vertical obstacle less wide than you                 |
    | Imp Cover   | +4 AC and reflex.  Evasion. | An arrow slit in a tower                                                    |

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Concealment</mark></summary>

*   Many other mechanics will refer to concealment when concerning things that obscure creatures and stealth. Things like darkness, fog, smoke etc. Without the ability to see through these things, creatures in these kinds of conditions have concealment, which is broken up into two categories.

    | Partial Concealment | <p>You can still see the creature, but in a limited capacity. Either you can only see their shadow, you're trying to avert your gaze or there are poor environmental conditions/magic at play.<br>When attacking creatures with partial concealment, you have -2 attack.</p> |
    | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Total Concealment   | <p>You cannot see the creature. Either they are in complete darkness or are deep in a fog cloud.<br>When attacking a creature with total concealment, you have -4 attack.</p>                                                                                                |

Concealment is a condition that's relative to the senses of other creatures. If you have dark vision and your opponent doesn't in a situation with complete darkness, you have concealment to them, but they don't have concealment to you.

Attacking from concealment, even total concealment, does not DD. You still need to use stealth as normal.

<mark style="color:green;">How do I attack something I can't see?</mark>

You might wonder how you can even attack a creature that darts into a cloud of fog. In most situations, you are aware of the roundabout position of your enemies unless they [hide](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/stealth#hide-immediate). You know they just darted around a corner, or you can hear their boots clank against the stone steps. In those situations, you are letting your less precise senses guide your senses. A shot in the dark, so to speak.

Hence you can still hit them, its just significantly less likely. Effects that target singular creatures (like [charming gaze](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/shira/level-1/charming-gaze)) and don't require attack rolls cannot be used against creatures with total concealment.&#x20;
