# ⚔️ Attack Rolls

Attack rolls are any type of harmful effect targeting a creature that does not require a saving throw. This can be spells, swords or trying to push your foe off a cliff

| Default: | d20+(lvl)+(ability score)+/-(circumstances) |

In general AC is not a zero sum endeavor. If you successfully meet the AC number, you deal full damage.\
if you roll 10 higher than the AC number, you crit.\
If you roll under the AC number, but not by more than 5, you get a partial hit as you "graze" your opponent with your attack.

Creatures that aren't dual-wielding have only 1 attack by default. When you use your standard action to make multiple attacks, it's called a multi attack. You can distribute the attacks to creatures as you see fit, move in between them, before and after them (for certain AoE attacks like cleave, you usually need to stand still). By default a standard attack is considered a <mark style="color:red;">simple attack</mark>. Simple attacks are only rolling attack and damage, typically with no special effects tied to them. Special attacks allow for more versatility in play style. Unique weapons, class abilities, techniques and feats can grant these special attacks. <mark style="color:red;">Special attacks can usually only be performed once per turn.</mark>&#x20;

Special attacks universally have the \[martial] tag, allowing you to use the attack, damage and bonus effects of a held weapon or natural attack, even if it states you use another attack form, such as the transformation effects of the Beastmode technique tree, or tossing your foes around in Barbarism.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Grazing</mark></summary>

Grazing a foe with your attack halves the damage. To graze a foe, you must roll a value of at least their AC-5.

In addition to dealing half damage, you do not apply any on-hit effects, such as bleed. Most effects that require an attack roll, are assumed to be on hit effects. Effects that have an effect when you are "missed" also happen when you are grazed.&#x20;

If there is some type of effect that happens when a creature is attacked, such as the mimics sticky quality, this effect also triggers when they are grazed.

Crits multiply all damage by 1.5. This increases to 2x damage with a two-handed weapon.\
Crits automatically happen when you exceed a creature's AC by 10.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Dual-Wielding</mark></summary>

You can wield weapons in both hands as long as they both have the light property. Whenever you make an attack against a creature (unless combat maneuver) with one of your weapons (the "main hand"), you can make an additional simple attack (that cannot be replaced with any other type of attack) against the same creature with the other weapon (the "off hand") .

Because you strike with the 2 weapons in tandem, if the "main hand" attack is enough to defeat a creature, you cannot make an "off hand" attack against a different creature.

If you make a special attack that involves making multiple attacks, such as the [cleave](https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/weapon-rules/special-attacks) special attack, you can only make the "off hand" attack against the first creature you attack with it. If the special attack grants some special property to the weapon, like [weapon toss](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/warfare/level-1/weapon-toss-su) allowing you to throw any weapon, it does not do so for the off-hand unless specified otherwise.

If you gain additional limbs to wield weapons, you do not get more "main hand" or "off hand" attacks by default.

You cannot dual wield with natural attacks or unarmed strikes by default.

What occupies your character's hands at any given time is very important. With only 2 hands, you're often going to need to make some sacrifices to do what you want on a given turn. With the versatility of the "[swap gear](publish-your-docs-4/publish-your-docs.md#swap-gear)" action, you can always adapt to the situation.

Spellcasting in this game requires occupying a hand with a magical focus, weapons take up hands, shields and you still might want empty hands for interacting with objects or grappling. This might not seem like much, but with how much everybody gets increased access to magic, you're going to find a lot more people with staves at the ready.

Some weapons require you use 2 hands to wield them. If you choose to let go with one of your hands such as to wield a stave, grapple a creature or fiddle with some factory controls, you cannot attack with the 2h weapon until the start of your next turn.&#x20;
