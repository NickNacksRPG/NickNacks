# ðŸ«¸ Combat Maneuvers and Poise

Combat maneuvers are forms of attack that do not directly deal damage and are dependent on a stat called poise. Poise determines how difficult you are to toss around. It functions similarly to hp, but you subtract the attack roll from the target's poise. If this reduces them to 0 poise, they suffer the effects of the maneuver and their poise resets to maximum. Poise naturally resets after combat ends or by taking the total defense action. Other effects that toss characters around might also interact with poise. If poise is reduced via lowered stats without a combat maneuver being used, it drops to a minimum of 1 (unless otherwise specified).

Using a combat maneuver replaces melee attacks by default.

Poise is calculated as follows. Common things like armor, shields and feats add to poise.  All bonuses to poise stack.

Any damage reduction also applies to poise damage.

Combat maneuvers by default have the \[Martial] tag, allowing you to use the attack, damage and bonus effects of a held weapon or natural attack, even if it states you use another attack form.
