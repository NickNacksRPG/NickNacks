# ðŸ«· Types of Combat Maneuvers

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Bully" %}
Deal poise damage without the chance of breaking a creature's poise, setting it to a minimum of 1. (AKA the combo starter)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Disarm" %}
Knock a held item out of a creatureâ€™s hand, landing at their feet. It takes 30 ft of movement or a standard action to pick up an item off the ground, which provokes an AoO.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Drag" %}
Grab a creature's hair, tail or other loose item on their person and take them for a ride.

Target creature stays adjacent to you for the remainder of your turn, allowing you to move them up to 30 ft. This is reduced to 10 feet if they are larger than you and you do not possess exceptional strength with which to carry them.

If the creature is not adjacent to you when you successfully drag, they are automatically pulled adjacent to you. You can choose any space within your natural reach to place the creature in at the end of your drag (both of these count against the distance you can drag).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Dirty Trick" %}
Spit in a creatures eyes, pull down their pants or do some other kind of maneuver to temporarily bother your enemy.

Apply clumsy 1, sickened 1 or blurred vision to a creature. They must spend a standard action to get rid of the condition.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Grapple" %}
Get tangled up with a foe, twisting their limbs and holding them still.

Your foe are entangled and your speed is zero. Pull the creature adjacent to you. The creature cannot threaten, meaning they cannot flank or make AoOs. Each round you can spend your standard action to keep the target in place and make an attack (but not a multiattack) against them with a melee attack, requiring no roll.

If you are moved out of reach from the target, have your poise reduced to zero, or are otherwise unable to maintain your grip, the target is freed.

<mark style="color:green;">Special:</mark> Multiple creatures can grapple one creature. The bonus to attack against a target that is entangled from a grapple increases by 2 per additional creature.\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Special:</mark> You must use at least one prehensile limb to initiate and maintain a grapple on a creature.\
<mark style="color:green;">Special:</mark> Creatures ignore the attack penalty from partial and total concealment against creatures that they are being grappled by or are grappling.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Knockdown" %}
Trip your foe, crush their toes or smack them out of the sky.

Inflict Knockdown, reducing a creatures speed by 30 and giving all creatures a +2 bonus to attack against them for 1 round. Being knocked down underwater or while airborne might visually be different, but is effectively the same.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">But what if I have more than 30 speed? Doesn't that mean I stood up? Do creatures still get a bonus to attack against me?</mark>

Creatures still get a bonus to attack against you. Getting knocked over represents a slow turn for the knocked down creature. They move unsteadily trying to regain their footing in an ever changing battlefield. \

If you want more game dev thoughts keep reading.\
I'll be real with you, in a turn based game this type of effect is a bit hard to accomplish while being in flavor. Similar games have a "prone" condition that you can only remove manually on your turn. This makes it so the knocked down creatures position in initiative determines how effective this CC will be. If they immediately go after you when you knocked 'em over, then the CC ends almost immediately. In general I don't like it when initiative position interacts with the power level of features beyond deciding who gets to use abilities first.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Shove" %}
Put your full body behind a push to get an enemy away from you or an ally.

Push a creature 10 feet in a direction away from you.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sunder" %}
Damage your foe's gear by cutting holes in it or bending it out of shape.

Target a piece of your opponent's equipment. With a different effect depending on the item you target.

* Attacks made against a creature with sundered armor get a +1 bonus.
* Bucklers give you a -2 penalty on attempts to parry
* Shields no longer grant poise, and cannot be used to perform special attacks
* Weapons cannot be used to perform special attacks
* Spells cast from a broken staff/seal have their CL reduced by 2 (min 0).&#x20;
* Magic items cannot be activated for 1 minute.

Equipment repairs usually cost 10% of the base price.
