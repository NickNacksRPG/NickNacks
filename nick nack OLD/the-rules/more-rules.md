# More Rules

Rules for things that are important, but don't take up nearly as much space.

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Rounding</mark></summary>

Whenever you round, always round down. Any decimal value is rounded down universally.

25 damage lightning bolt and you passed your save for half damage?\
12 damage.

Bone Chilled and heal 9?\
Heal 4.\

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Light</mark></summary>

Light comes in 3 forms.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Bright Light</mark>\
A sunny day or a torch lit room.  Bright light let's creatures see things clearly.\
Most creatures can see in bright light without any penalty

<mark style="color:yellow;">Dim Light</mark>\
Moonlight or at the edge of your torch light. Many humanoids cannot see well in dim light. Features in dim light appear only as a silhouette with dull, if any, color.\
Without special senses, creatures have partial concealment in dim light.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Darkness</mark>\
The depths of a cave or deep underwater.  Few creatures can see clearly in a complete darkness. Some, such as humans, can't see at all. Those that can (such as with night vision or darkvision) still only see in grayscale.\
Without special senses, creatures have total concealment in darkness.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Advantage and Disadvantage</mark></summary>

There are many abilities in the game that allow you additional odds success in some limited capacity. These are usually represented through rerolls and advantage.

Rerolls do as they might suggest; they allow you to roll dice again after you didn't like the result. Whenever you use a reroll on a dice roll that you have advantage or disadvantage on, you make that reroll with advantage or disadvantage.

Advantage allows you to roll 2 dice and take the desired of the 2 results. Inversely, disadvantage forces you to roll 2 dice and take the lower of the 2 results. Multiple instances of advantage allow you to roll the dice more, 3, 4, maybe even 5 times and take the desired result. Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out.

*   If that’s confusing, treat advantage as +1 and disadvantage as -1 in the chart below.

    | -3 | Etc.                       |
    | -- | -------------------------- |
    | -2 | Roll 3 dice, take lowest   |
    | -1 | Roll 2 dice, take lowest   |
    | 0  | Roll 1 dice                |
    | +1 | Roll 2 dice, choose result |
    | +2 | Roll 3 dice, choose result |
    | +3 | Etc.                       |

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Attacks of Opportunity (AoOs)</mark></summary>

An attack of opportunity is an instant action attack a creature makes in response to an action that is generally unsafe or unwieldy. AoOs always happen before the triggering action. AoOs can typically only be made with melee weapons.

Without the combat reflexes feat, creatures can only make 1 AoO, resetting at the top of initiative.

Common things that provoke:

* Making a ranged attack
* Leaving an opponent's threatened spaces
* Strafing

Strafing is movement inside of an opponents threatened spaces that does not move you directly closer to it. IE walking around the creature in order to get into a flanking position or moving past them to get to another enemy while not leaving their threatened spaces. In essence, while threatened, you can't ignore the creature.

A creature that is unable to take a standard action cannot make attacks of opportunity.\
If a creature has total concealment, they cannot be AoO’d.\
AoOs are simple attacks by default.\
AoOs do not suffer the multi-attack penalty

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Luck Checks</mark></summary>

When the chance something will happen or fail to happen is based purely on chance, you attempt a luck check. You roll a d20, add (or subtract) luck and compare the result on the die to the DC. You can't add your luck to a luck check twice. Nothing else can be added to luck checks (unless otherwise specified).

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Fall Damage</mark></summary>

Fall damage increases by 3 crush for every 10 feet you fall, capped at 60 damage.  Every 50 feet you are also drained 1, capped at 4.

Fall damage also deals poise damage equal to hp damage. Your poise drops to zero as a result of fall damage, you or knocked down.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Mounted Combat</mark></summary>

Mounting can be done as a swift action on an adjacent creature. The mounting creature must be 1 size category smaller than the mount. You cannot mount a creature if your speed is reduced to zero.

If the creature does not have equipment to facilitate mounting, combat maneuvers have advantage against you. If you or your mount are toppled or shoved, you are dismounted in addition to the combat maneuver's effects.

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">High Ground</mark></summary>

In order to have high ground, you need to at least have a 10 ft elevation on them.

When you have high ground, you ignore the attack penalty for ranged weapons in the second increment.
