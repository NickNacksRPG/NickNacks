Typically creatures have a speed of 30 ft, if a speed isn't listed, assume 30. You can move before and after performing your other actions. Some abilities or status effects will reduce your movement speed. If your speed is reduced to 0, you cannot move, even if you dash.

You can climb and swim at half speed, provided you aren't trying to swim during a storm or climb up a smooth wall. With certain racial/class abilities or proficiency in the athletics skill, you can swim/climb at full speed.
