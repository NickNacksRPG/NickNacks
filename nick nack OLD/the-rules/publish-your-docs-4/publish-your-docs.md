# ‼️ Common Combat Actions



{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Dash" %}
Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">Standard</mark>\
Double your speed this round. Has no effect if your speed is zero.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Charge" %}
Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">FRA</mark>\
Move at twice your speed in a straight line, halting when your foe is adjacent, or at least within reach. Make your attack(s) against a creature. Creatures get a +2 bonus to attack against you until the start of your next turn. If your charge gets interrupted for whatever reason, you must make your attack(s) from your halted position. You cannot charge a creature that is adjacent to you.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Disengage" %}
Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">Standard</mark>\
Completely focus on finding openings in the battlefield. Your movement is \[elusive] this turn, making it not provoke attacks of opportunity (AoO).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Jump" %}
Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">Swift</mark>\
Can only be used in combination with other forms of movement such as walking or charging. Jump once 5 feet long or half that in height. This does not give you additional movement, and the thus it is limited by your speed.  Can be used to avoid difficult terrain or hazards.

Jump action can only be made 1/turn. If you dash and take the jump action, you can jump twice with the same swift action.

Jump distance increases by 5 ft per point of strength (or dexterity if trained in acrobatics).

You cannot jump while standing in a hazardous surface that would normally have some kind of negative effect while moving through it, such as difficult terrain or tripping and falling in an oil spill. You can jump over them just fine, just not if you're already stuck in them.
{% endtab %}

Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">Swift</mark>\
Retrieve and drink a potion, or similar type of consumable. Provokes AoOs.
{% endtab %}

Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">Standard</mark>\
Give an ally within your natural reach one of the following bonuses for 1 round: +2 attack, +2 saves, +2 AC. Or get rid of 1 stack of clumsy, shaken, sickened, knockdown. Many effects that entangle and snare can be removed with athletics. You can use the aid action to help an ally escape.

You can aid a defeated creature bringing them to 1 hp when not in combat. Extreme circumstances may require more assistance to restore a creature particularly out of it (such as medicine or magic).
{% endtab %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Administer Potion" %}
Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">Standard</mark>\
Give a potion to an unconscious ally. A conscious ally must spend an immediate action to drink an administered potion. You can use either your potions, or potions the ally has.

{% tab title="Delay" %}
Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">Free</mark>\
You can decide to wait to act in initiative, acting whenever you like at the end of another creature's turn, permanently changing your position in initiative.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Prepare" %}
Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">Varies</mark>\
You can prepare swift actions, movement, free actions and standard actions to react to 1 specific trigger (ex “a goblin opens this door, I walk up to him and shove him off the cliff”).  If the triggering action never happens, you don't get your actions back.

When you prepare a standard action to attack, you can only prepare a single attack.

You cannot prepare actions outside of initiative.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Carry" %}
Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">FRA</mark>\
Move your speed and bring a willing creature along with you. If you do not have the carryweight to carry them, then you can double your carryweight to drag them, moving at half speed. If you cannot drag them, you cannot use this action.\
\
The creature you carry becomes clumsy 1 unless they are defeated or you aren't in combat.\
This can be combined with additional actions to gain additional/more varied movement (such as jump or rogue's cunning action).\
\
Against incapacitated creatures, you can instead to use a drag combat maneuver. It automatically succeeds and has no range limitation.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Focus" %}
Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">Standard</mark>

Choose a creature you can see. For 1 round you gain the following benefits...

* Your movement is \[elusive] to them
* You can take an immediate action as an instant action 1/turn in response to their actions.
* You cannot be denied instant/immediate actions against this foe by being DD

While you focus on a creature, you pay less attention to all other creatures, and are automatically DD to them. You can choose to continue or end focus on a creature on subsequent turns as a free action.

<mark style="color:green;">Special</mark> - In organized duels, it is assumed both characters start the combat in this state. In such circumstances, they ignore the DD portion of this action (for companions and such).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Get Down!" %}
Action Type: <mark style="color:green;">Immediate</mark>\
Throw yourself into the way of an attack made against a helpless creature. This could mean a minion, someone who is asleep or defeated. You can choose to become the target of all danger aimed at them, including AoE, spells and attacks. Such attacks automatically hit you and you get no saving throws against spells.

You naturally need to be aware of an attack to protect against it. If a creature manages to give you the slip with stealth, then you can't protect.

If the attack was originally a crit, it crits you instead automatically.
