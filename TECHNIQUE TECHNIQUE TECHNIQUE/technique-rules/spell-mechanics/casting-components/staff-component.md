# Staff Component

Staves, Seals, Wands etc\
In general the staff component serves much the same function no matter its shape, but there are some small differences.

<mark style="color:green;">Staves</mark> - Staves are usually long and sturdy pieces of wood. Most of the magical components of the staff are attached to the end of it. Staves can universally be used as weapons.

<mark style="color:green;">Seals</mark> - Seals have an enormous amount of variety to them. But they are typically compact: Some small handheld object, often of spiritual significance. Seals are ineffective unless they are the only thing occupying the hand.

<mark style="color:green;">Wands</mark> - Wands are usually small pieces of wood about in the rough shape of a pencil, but usually a bit larger. Wands usually come pre-built in with a cantrip.

Other sufficiently magical things can potentially be used as magical foci with their own unique benefits such as books giving access to more spells. Dual wielding these items gives +1 CL.
