# Casting Components

All spells have some kind of visual effect associated with their casting before the effect occurs.  Magic circles shining fingers and eyes, words manifesting into physical objects and circling the caster are all means to easily identify when a creature is casting a spell. The only exception to this being spells with the \[Subtle] tag.\
All spells have a verbal component. Verbal components cannot be whispered, and you must speak them clearly. Anything that prevents the mage from speaking prevents them from casting, such as being silenced.&#x20;

This rule applies to innate casting.&#x20;

\---

All spells have a staff/seal component. Disarming a mage of their staff/seal prevents them from casting using it.\
Any spell with a material component has an item with a price associated with that is consumed on use.\
Anything with a focus component has an item with a price associated that is NOT consumed on use.&#x20;

These rules do not apply to innate casting.
