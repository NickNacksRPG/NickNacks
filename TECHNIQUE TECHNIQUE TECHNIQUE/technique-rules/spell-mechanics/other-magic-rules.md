# Other Magic Rules

<details>

<summary>Caster Level (CL)</summary>

Caster level (CL) is typically equal to the creature's level, though certain effects can change it. CL determines the effectiveness of many spells.

This stat is also relevant in resolving what happens when casting goes head to head with each other (such as with dispel magic), when using healing to staunch bleeding or when light and darkness magic meet.&#x20;

If dual wielding staff components, get +1 CL.

<summary>Spell Failure</summary>

By default, spells have a 100% chance of being cast, but certain things can cause spell failure. When spell failure causes your spell to fail, the resource used to cast it is consumed. A spell failing is usually shortened to "fizzles."

<summary>Combining Magic Effects</summary>

Many spells give you some kind of buff, or generate some kind of persistent effect.  You can only have one type of each of the following effects active at once.

\[Concentration]\
An effect with the concentration tag requires some degree of upkeep from the user and typically has a duration.  Things like wall spells and summons have the concentration tag.

\[Buff]\
An ability with the buff tag grants a boon to the creature it is applied to (and not necessarily the user).  A creature can only have one effect with the buff tag active at once.  Buffs can only be cast on willing creatures.

<summary>Weather</summary>

Certain high level spells manipulate the weather in drastic ways. If multiple casters attempt to cast different spells that affect the weather, the creature with the higher CL always wins.

In the event where the caster tries to interfere with weather that is supernaturally powerful (created by a complex ritual, associated with cursed terrain etc), the DM should assign the effect an effective CL.

All weather inducing spells do not function underground.
