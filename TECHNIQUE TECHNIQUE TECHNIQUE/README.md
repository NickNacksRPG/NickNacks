# Technique Rules

Progression in this game is broken up into 3 main distinct categories: Class features, feats and techniques. This section is dedicated to techniques. Techniques use a point system to represent how invested you are in a specific technique, from 1 to 6.

Techniques are often things that you use in combat, such as special attacks and spells.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Memory</mark></summary>

When you have technique points invested in a specific style, you can prepare any of the techniques of the tier you have unlocked. Memory determines how many techniques you can have prepared or "memorized" at any given time and thus what you can use on a dime.

All techniques are assumed to take 1 memory unless stated otherwise.

Special attacks from items/class/etc and cantrips to not require memory.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Using Multiple Techniques a Turn</mark></summary>

Techniques can be any kind of action, leading them to be able to be used twice, maybe even more times a turn. Techniques are not balanced in such a way to be allowed to freely use some of your most powerful abilities multiple times a turn.

Therefore there is an inherent limit tied to techniques. You can only use up to 2 levels of techniques at level 1, 3 at level 3, 4 at level 5 etc, increasing by 1 every 2 levels and capping at 7 by level 11. This essentially limits you to using level 1 techniques in tandem with your most powerful available techniques.&#x20;

This limit even applies to innate techniques, however there is a small exception. Sometimes you may receive some incredible boon, or a monster might have a technique a bit higher than their level might suggest. In such cases, no additional techniques can be used in the same turn as this high level technique.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Innate Casting/Techniques</mark></summary>

Some techniques can be granted outside of the standard progression, such as things gained from race, class, magic item,  specialized training, or some kind of boon granted by another creature. Usually quite limited in scope and much more common on monsters.

Innate techniques do not take up memory slots and are always memorized.

Innate techniques grant creatures the ability to use a specific set of techniques. Spells do not require the staff/seal component that other casting typically requires. If a spell has a material or focus component, that is also ignored with innate casting. By default, creatures with innate techniques can use their techniques an unlimited number of times. Number values are included next to techniques that have limited uses per day.

Mana burn still applies to innately casted spells. But otherwise they cost no mana.

If a spell is constant, the spell is persistently active on the creature and takes up its buff slot. A new buff can be cast on it, rendering the constant spell inactive. If its constant spell is deactivated, it can reactivate it as a swift action.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Technique Progression</mark></summary>

In general, classes get access to a few technique trees. Techniques are separated into six levels, requiring 6 points of investment in order to reach the highest tier.

At every even level, you get a technique point you can invest in any form of technique. For every point you invest, you get access to a new level of technique.

* There are some limitations. You cannot invest all of your technique points into the techniques your class specializes in to get access to high level abilities extremely early. Technique levels have a hard character level requirement, as shown belowâ€¦
*

    | Technique Level (and points required) | Character Level |
    | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
    | 1                                     | 1               |
    | 2                                     | 3               |
    | 3                                     | 5               |
    | 4                                     | 7               |
    | 5                                     | 9               |
    | 6                                     | 11              |

Techniques are also separated into two different general categories: martial and magic. Each class typically has a specialization in either one of these categories.

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Martial/Magical Specialization</mark></summary>

With martial specialization, you automatically gain points in warfare equal to the highest level of investment you have in martial techniques (ex. Have barbarism 3? You also have warfare 3).



Magical specialization as a baseline gives you access to cantrips. You know 6 cantrips. You do not need to spend memory in order to prepare cantrips.\
You automatically gain points in wild card equal to the highest level of investment you have in magical techniques (ex. Have pyromancy 3? You also have wild card 3).

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Upcast</mark></summary>

My spending additional mana, you can increase the effectiveness of the technique. Some techniques scale per additional mana spent and others require thresholds to get completely new effects.\
You can only ever spend 6 mana on a technique.
