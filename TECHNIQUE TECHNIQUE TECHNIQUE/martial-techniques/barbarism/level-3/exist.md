As part of the initiative roll you can choose a creature within range. That creature is taunted (will negates). To that creature, your very existence infuriates them and you must be stopped at all cost. At the end of each of their turns, they get a new save to end the effect.

If you are at or below 50% hp when this ability triggers, increase the DC by 2. If on subsequent turns, you take no actions on your turn other than movement, the DC increases by 2.

If this creature is defeated, then you may choose a new creature to affect with this ability (no action required, happens immediately).
