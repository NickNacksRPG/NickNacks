You manifest a cart of your own design. Every time you manifest this cart, it is the same cart. The cart is capable of holding a dozen or so people and has an extra dimensional cargo space (5-ft cube). You can cause this cart to vanish back to the cart realm as a FRA.

While attached to and dragging your cart, your land speed doubles. To you, the contents within the cart are completely weightless. To anybody else, it weighs 10k lbs.

The cart lasts indefinitely, but disappears while you donâ€™t have this technique memorized.
