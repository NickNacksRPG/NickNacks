You need to defeat the creature on the same turn that you land this attack for it to have its effect. The creature is never killed by your attacks this turn.

You deal an additional 2d8 (9) damage. The target forgets anything that happened while defeated, and anything that happened a minute before being defeated.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d8 (4).
