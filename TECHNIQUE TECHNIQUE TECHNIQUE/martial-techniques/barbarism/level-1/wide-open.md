Call out to your foes to hit you where it hurts. Provoke an attack of opportunity from all creatures currently threatening you. Wary creatures who do not want to make an AoO must make a will save. Failure means they do it anyway.

You may make an additional simple melee attack against any creature that AoO's you as a result of this technique.
