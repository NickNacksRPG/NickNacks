Wipe the blood, sludge or ectoplasm off of a creature and apply it to yourself to get yourself in the mood for battle. You must initially target a defeated creature or yourself if you are below 10 hp.

After you apply the blood to yourself, gain +15 speed, a +4 bonus to intimidation checks. When you critically strike, you deal an additional 50% damage. Most weapons now do 2x damage on a crit, and 2h weapons deal 2.5x damage on a crit.
