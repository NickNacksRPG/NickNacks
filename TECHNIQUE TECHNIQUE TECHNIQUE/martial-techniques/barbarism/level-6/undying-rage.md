While you have this technique applied to you, your eyes glow a dark red and your resting emotional state is angry.

The first time you are defeated and the effect is not negated by another feature, such as ferocity or the Diehard feat, this contingency activates.

You become completely immune to death. Every time you take damage that would defeat you, you can instead decide to become drained 1. This drain does not cause you to fall unconscious. When you become drained 20, you instantly die.
