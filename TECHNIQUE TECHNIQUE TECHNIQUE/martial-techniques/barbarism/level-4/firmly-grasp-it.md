Make a disarm attack with a +4 bonus. Instead of knocking the weapon out of the creatures hand, you violently stab it into the creature's hand, dealing 3d8 (13) additional damage. The creature cannot use that hand or weapon until the weapon is removed as a standard action with athletics (class DC).

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d8 (4).
