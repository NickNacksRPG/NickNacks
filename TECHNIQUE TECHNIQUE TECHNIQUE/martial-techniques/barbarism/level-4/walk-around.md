<table><thead><tr><th width="161">Effect</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Range</td><td>Reach or 30 ft</td></tr><tr><td>Target</td><td>1 creature</td></tr><tr><td>Save</td><td>Will (see text)</td></tr></tbody></table>

You can walk around. You spend all of your actions moving and doing nothing else, ending your movement at some point within 30 feet of where you started walking around. Naturally this behavior befuddles the creatures around you. All enemies within 60 feet of this initial starting point are confused (will adds 2 to d10 roll). The effect ends when creature gets the result "act normally."

Creatures that make an AoO against you when you move take a -2 penalty to their save.

You may continue spending your turns walking around to maintain this confusion effect as long as you want, the same creature cannot be confused more than once.

This has no effect on creatures not engaged in combat with you.
