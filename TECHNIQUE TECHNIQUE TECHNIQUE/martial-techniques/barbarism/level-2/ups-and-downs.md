On hit deal an additional d8 (4) damage and smash a creature into the ground, or throw them directly up into a low roof within 10 ft. In either case, the creature is entangled until they use athletics to escape as a swift action. If you throw the creature into a roof, they are also unable to see and interact with the floor below until they escape.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d8 (4).
