Make a grapple attack. Instead of grappling them, you make a bonus thrown weapon attack using the poise broken creature as ammunition.

The attack always deals full damage to the poise broken creature. If you graze the secondary target, it does not change the damage against the initial target. If you crit, they are both crit. All creatures affected take an additional d8 (4) damage.&#x20;

If you are already grappling the creature when you initiate the attack, you don't need to grapple them again.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d8 (4).
