Make a grapple or disarm attack. If successful, instead of grappling or disarming, tear off your opponents arm causing them to be drained 1 (fort removes drain and reduces to broken arm, which renders it useless until medicine check to provide first aid, DC=class/offense trait DC).

Make an attack against them with their own arm that deals an additional 4d8 (18) dmg.
