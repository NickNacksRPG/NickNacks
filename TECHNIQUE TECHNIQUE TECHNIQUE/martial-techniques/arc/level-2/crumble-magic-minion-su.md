<table><thead><tr><th width="161">Effect</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Target</td><td>1 creature</td></tr></tbody></table>

If you land this attack against a magically created minion, such as an undead or a summoned creature, you automatically deal the attack's damage to the creature that created the effect too if they are within 100 ft of you.

In the case of summoning contracts, it still damages whoever summoned them, not the real body of the creature being summoned.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d8 (4). If you spend at least 3 mana, the attack damages all the companion creatures, in addition to their creator/summoner.&#x20;
