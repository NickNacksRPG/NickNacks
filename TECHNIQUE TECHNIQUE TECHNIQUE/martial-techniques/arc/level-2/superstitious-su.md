You see magical auras around mages constantly. You learn the highest level spell a creature can cast by focusing on them as a standard action.

You automatically get a check to see a creatureâ€™s true form (will save vs their class/offense trait DC). If you strike a creature disguising their true form, they revert back to it (will negates).
