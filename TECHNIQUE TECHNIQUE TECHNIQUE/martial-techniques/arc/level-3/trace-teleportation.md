You gain a 6th sense allowing you to detect when a teleportation effect has happened in the area recently. Such spots appear as silhouettes of portals. While adjacent to such a space, you can inspect it more closely to glean further details.

You can automatically tell the distance and direction of the teleportation effect. If the effect teleported the creature to another plane, you know what plane instead of the distance. You can roll an arcana check (DC 10+CL of the effect, or 10+the creatures level for non spell effects) to gaze into this pseudo portal to see exactly where the creature teleported to, as though looking through a window to their destination. You see it as it currently is, not as it looked when they went, using all of your senses.

If you are capable of getting to this destination while the same use of this ability persists, you need not make further checks to see any chain of teleportation that may have occurred from the same caster.
