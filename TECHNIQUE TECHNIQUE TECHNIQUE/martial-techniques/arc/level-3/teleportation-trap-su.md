When you place this sigil, you must designate a location within its AoE on a surface visible from where it is placed. Unlike most other sigils, a teleportation trap is not triggered by moving within a certain radius of it. A creature that teleports within 120 feet of the sigil, even without direct line of effect, is immediately affected by the trap and teleported to this predesignated location instead of their intended destination (will reduces effect to clumsy 1).

If you place a Teleportation Trap while you already have one active, the previous one disappears.

Upcast 6 - The sigil becomes permanent and its AoE increases to 300 ft.
