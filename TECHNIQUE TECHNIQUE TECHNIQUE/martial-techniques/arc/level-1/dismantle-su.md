You create a transparent but clearly visible wall that partially unweaves magic that passes through it. Any spell or supernatural (Su) effect that passes through the wall has its attack bonus and DC decreased by 2.

You can also choose to form the barrier into a hemisphere centered on you with a radius equal to half the walls dimensions.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - Per each additional mana spent, increase the dimensions of the wall by 10 ft (20x20, 30x30 etc)
