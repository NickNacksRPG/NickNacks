You hit a creature in the head hard enough to cause it to forget its own training. On hit the creature forgets a technique of your choosing. In order to remove a specific technique, you must have seen the technique get used, hear about a specific creature's technique from someone who has seen it or succeed on a monster lore check against the creature to reveal its offense traits.

For creatures with class levels that prepare techniques this can be a bit awkward since they can swap techniques so you're gonna have to play it by ear.

If you don't have a specific technique in mind, the creature forgets one of its highest tier techniques known if it prepares them, or a 1/day innate technique (that it hasn't used yet) if it doesn't. Move down the list until you get something that fits, with the idea being remove most important and powerful tech first.

A creature with Amnesia can spend a standard action to try and remember the technique. Martial techniques require a DC 5 intelligence check while magical techniques require a DC 20 intelligence check.
