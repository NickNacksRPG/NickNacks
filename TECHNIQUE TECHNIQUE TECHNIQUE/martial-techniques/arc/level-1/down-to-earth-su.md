<table><thead><tr><th width="161">Effect</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Target</td><td>1 creature</td></tr></tbody></table>

You infuse your weapon with the ability to tangle a creatures wings or the magic that holds it afloat in the air. Make a weapon attack that applies grounded for 1 round.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d8 (4). At 3 mana, the grounded duration increases to 3 rounds. At 5 mana, this debuff gains the \[curse] effect.&#x20;

The curse only ends when the creature consumes a creature known to fly, even if only sparingly, such as a chicken, or its egg.
