# Beastmode

The techniques surrounding using natural attacks, and briefly transforming into animals. All beastmode features are supernatural.

As a reminder, <mark style="color:red;">ALL</mark> special attacks have the \[martial] tag, even if it is not listed.

Martial effects allow the user to deliver the effect using the attack and damage and on-hit effects of a wielded weapon, even if it mentions using another form of attack.
