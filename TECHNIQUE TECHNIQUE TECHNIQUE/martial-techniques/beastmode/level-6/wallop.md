Grow long bestial arms to scoop up your foes and toss them in a specific direction. Choose a direction, then make a shove attempt with a +8 bonus and apply it to against all creatures within. Creatures successfully shoved are moved 20 ft in the direction you chose. If they impact solid terrain, they take 7d8+lvl (31+lvl) damage and are stunned for one round (fort reduces stun to daze).
