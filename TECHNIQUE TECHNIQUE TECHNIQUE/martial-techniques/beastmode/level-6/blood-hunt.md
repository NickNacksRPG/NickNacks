While this technique is prepared, you can smell everything as long as it bleeds. You gain the [Shirshu's](https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/bestiary/beasts/shirshu) Elite Tracker and Sightless Blindsense. These only function against wounded creatures, or against creatures whose blood you have smelled before.

You see a faint misty red trail leading directly to whatever you track, automatically succeeding on survival checks to track creatures whose blood you have smelled before.
