While this technique is prepared, your arms get coated in a thick fur and your fingers get claws at their ends. The claw attacks deal d8 slash damage, or d10 if your hands are empty. They have the CM (disarm) and CM (grapple) properties. If you already had claws, these qualities are only in addition to what you already had. Cannot decrease your claw dmg.

While wielding a gun, you get DR 20 vs disarm attacks.

You can make grapples and disarms as AoOs with your bear arms.

You gain a multi-attack option:\
