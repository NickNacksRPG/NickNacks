You establish a connection to your allies with 1 minute of intimate contact, adding them to your _<mark style="color:red;">hive mind</mark>._ While part of the hive mind, you are able to speak telepathically with them. You can choose to telepathically communicate with one, some or all members. All members of the hive also get an intuitive sense of each member's direction and distance.

You can form a hive mind with a number of creatures equal to your level.

If you ever stop preparing this technique, your hive mind disappears.
