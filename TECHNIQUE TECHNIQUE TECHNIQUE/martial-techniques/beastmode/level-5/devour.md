This move functions differently based on whether you target an ally or an enemy.

<mark style="color:green;">Enemy</mark>\
Against a creature you are grappling, this attack automatically works. If not already grappling, roll a grapple attack with a +4 bonus. If successful, you swallow the creature whole. While devoured, the creature inside is in stasis.

You gain access to the following special attack.\
<mark style="color:orange;">Spit Up</mark> - Spit out a devoured creature, hurling them up to 30 feet. The creature takes 6d8+lvl (27+lvl) crush damage and is knocked down. Creatures within 5 ft of the impact location are also knocked down (reflex negates).

If you do not use spit up on the following turn, the target is disgorged with no negative effects at the end of that turn.

<mark style="color:green;">Ally</mark>\
Devour a willing ally, they can hang out inside your stomach indefinitely, hearing muffled versions of things happening outside. As a free action, they can exit your stomach.

While inside, your ally cannot be targeted as though they had total cover. If you take damage or become sickened, you automatically vomit them out.
