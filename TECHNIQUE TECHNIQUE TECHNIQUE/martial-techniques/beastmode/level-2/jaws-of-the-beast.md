Grow massive powerful jaws and take a chomp your opponent. dealing an additional d8 (4) damage and latching onto them on hit. Until the start of your next turn, you stay adjacent to this target as it now needs to drag you along for the ride. You can decide which space you end adjacent to them after the creature moves.

Anything that prevents you from moving prevents the other creature from moving as well (such as being entangled). If you are poise broken you detach.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d8 (4).
