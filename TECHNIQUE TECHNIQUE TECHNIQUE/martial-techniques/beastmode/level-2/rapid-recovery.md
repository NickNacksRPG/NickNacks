While this technique is memorized, you regenerate lost limbs and organs, and in general recover much faster. You recover 1 stack of drained every 3 days instead of every week, as though receiving medical attention (doesn't stack). A lost limb/organ regrows within 3 days.

When you are defeated, you automatically regain 1 hit point after 10 minutes.

As a swift action, you can heal 10 hp, regrow a limb instantly and make yourself drained 1.
