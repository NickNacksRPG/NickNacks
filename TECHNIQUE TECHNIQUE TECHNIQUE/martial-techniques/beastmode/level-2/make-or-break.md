You can cause pieces of your body to detach, such as your hands or legs. Basically anything that isn't your head or your torso. When you do so, you are drained 1.

These pieces of your body grow back slowly over time, making a full recovery when you recover from the drain. If you are able to retrieve your detached limbs, this recovery time decreases to 1 hour, during which constant contact is required between the detached limb and where it was detached from.

This technique does not allow you to recover limbs you didn't have before using the technique.
