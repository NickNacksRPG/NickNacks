Transform into a beast creature you can see. You do not copy their appearance exactly, only their species. You gain the creature's senses, movement types and natural attacks, but nothing else. A pattern appears in your fur/scales etc that matches the symbol of Mother Earth.

How others of the species react to you depends on the species. Some creatures are territorial, others are social and others don't care.

If you \[mana burn] you can increase the duration to 10 minutes.
