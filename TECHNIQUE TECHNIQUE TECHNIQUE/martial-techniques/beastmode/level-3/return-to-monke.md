Assume the form of a tiny monkey indefinitely with the following qualities (see shapeshifter). You can exit this transformation as a standard action.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="210"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Speed</td><td>Climb</td></tr><tr><td>Smol</td><td>Tiny</td></tr><tr><td>Prehensile</td><td>Tail</td></tr><tr><td>Bother</td><td>Make noise to taunt an enemy within 30 feet into attacking you (will negates). Lasts 1 minute, but the taunted creature gets a new save after each turn.</td></tr><tr><td>Attack</td><td>Bite</td></tr></tbody></table>

While in this form, you gain 2 abilities. Both usable as a standard action.

<mark style="color:green;">One of Us \[poly, true]</mark> - While in monkey form, you reach over and touch a creature with your tiny monkey hands. The creature also turns into a tiny monkey (fort reduces to stagger 1 round).

<mark style="color:green;">Ohhh Banana \[mind-affecting]</mark> - You procure a shiny golden banana that hovers in the air for 1 minute. All creatures you turned into a monkey are automatically fascinated. Other monkey/ape-like creatures  are fascinated (will negates).
