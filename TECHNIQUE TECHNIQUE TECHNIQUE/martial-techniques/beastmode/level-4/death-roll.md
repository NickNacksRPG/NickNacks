{% hint style="info" %}
Can only be used against a grappled or knocked down creature.
{% endhint %}

You chomp down onto a creature with excessive force and spin them around. If the creature is grappled, they are knocked down and take an additional 3d8 (13) damage and are made clumsy 2. If they are knocked down, you initiate a grapple and take an additional 3d8 (13) damage and are made clumsy 2.

If the target is neither grappled nor knocked down, you can attempt one such maneuver as a free action on hit.

When you maintain a grapple against a creature after using this technique against them without the grapple ever being broken, they are made clumsy 2.&#x20;
