Create 3 copies of a held melee weapon, natural attack or unarmed strike that float around your head. While these persist, gain +2 attack. As part of casting using this technique, and as a swift action each subsequent turn, you can make a simple melee attack with that weapon and consume a copy. This attack functions exactly like making a simple attack with the weapon normally, but deals an additional d8 (4) dmg.
