You coat your hand in fire and deal 2 fire damage to a creature (other than yourself) as you slap it on the back. The creature gains resistance to frost damage and negates the next instance of frosty or wet. It can also remove said status effects immediately.

You can also destroy other flammable things restricting their movement or actions, like webs, vines etc.

Once this buff resists frost or negates a status effect, it ends.
