# Pupper

Cinder Tourneau is an influential adventurer that lived through not one, but two different world crises while fighting to stop it. Once upon a time she had the blood of fiends run through her veins but has since been transformed by a mad scientist and retired. Even when she was a child she would charge at foes many times her size without fear by the side of her parents. The memory of this cute pupper still inspires people to this day to fight greater evils.

Pupper techniques are focused on providing useful combat buffs, aggression, speed and putting you straight into the action to slap people in melee.
