Unleash a sonic blast at a creature as though using a thrown weapon attack that deals your unarmed damage +d8 (4) as sonic damage. This attack has seeking. As long as that creature stays within 60 ft of you, you know it's exact position and gain seeking against it until the end of your next turn.

At any point before the end of your next turn, you can spend an immediate action to dash to their location and to make an unarmed strike against them that deals an additional 2d8 (9) dmg.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage of the follow-up attack by d8 (4).
