Scramble to find something to take the hit for you against an incoming attack. Decrease their attack bonus by 2 and the object breaks. They maintain this -2 attack penalty as their weapon gets stuck in the object. They can remove it as a swift action.

Must have a free hand to use this ability. There must also be suitable object with which to block the attack, such as a piece of furniture.
