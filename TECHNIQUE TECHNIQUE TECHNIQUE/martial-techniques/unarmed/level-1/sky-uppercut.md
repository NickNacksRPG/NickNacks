You must be on the ground to use this ability.

As part of using this technique, you can leap 60 ft into the air directly up and make an unarmed melee attack. You are immune to fall damage during the turn you use this technique.

If you can fly, you can choose to stay airborne at the peak of your leap. If you have glide, you can use it to adjust your landing location.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d8 (4).
