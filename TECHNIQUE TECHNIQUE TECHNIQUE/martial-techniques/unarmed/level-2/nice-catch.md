When a creature targets you with a melee attack using a manufactured weapon (sword, spear etc.), you can opt to grab their weapon mid swing. Roll an opposed attack roll. If you meet or exceed their roll, you successfully negate their attack and grab their weapon, rendering them unable to use it for further attacks.

While the weapon is in hand, you lose access to the hand. You and your opponent cannot move away from each other without letting go of the weapon. If you are poise broken, or otherwise moved out of reach, you let go of the weapon. While you hold a weapon, you get a +4 bonus to sunder attempts against it.
