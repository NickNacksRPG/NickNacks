In response to an ally being harmed you can immediately grant them 30 temporary hp, increasing to 50 if they are below half hp.

You must continue to actively concentrate on this ability to maintain this temp hp. If you maintain concentration for 1 full round, you can teleport adjacent to this ally as an instant action.

This ability can be used over any distance, however, you must still have some means of knowing when an ally is within danger, such as [sending](../../../magical-techniques/larella/level-1/sending.md) or being part of a [hive mind](../../beastmode/level-5/hive-mind.md).
