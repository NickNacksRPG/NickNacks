Mark a 30 ft line along the ground within range. A line of transparent symbols or shields appears to mark that area. If any creature walks through the barrier or tries to travel over or under it, their movement is halted and they are unable to pass through for 1 round (will negates).&#x20;

This line must be placed parallel to the ground.
