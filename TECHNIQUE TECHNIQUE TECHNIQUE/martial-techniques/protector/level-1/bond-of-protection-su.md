You siphon your allies' pain into your own body with this bond. While your ally is within 100 feet of you, you take half of their hp damage (with odd numbers, round so you receive more damage) applying resistances and DR as usual. This technique can defeat you. You cannot take more damage than you have hp (ie if you have 1 hp and your bond takes 100 dmg, they take 99, you take 1).
