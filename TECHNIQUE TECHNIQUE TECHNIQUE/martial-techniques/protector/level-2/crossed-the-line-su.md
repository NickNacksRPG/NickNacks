You create a visible line on the ground within that serves as a warning for your enemies. When an enemy steps into a space your line is in, or otherwise "crosses" it, you can move 30 ft closer to them \[elusive] and make an AoO against them as an instant action, as though they moved out of your threatened spaces.

Even if you run out of AoOs, you can still take the movement as often as enemies walk through the line.
