When attacked by a ranged projectile weapon, roll a reflex save against the creatures DC. If you succeed, you negate the attack entirely. If your opponents general weapon type matches yours (bow, gun) or is a thrown weapon, then you can also fire/throw it back as an instant action.

Particularly odd weapons (like the [Ray Gun](https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/magic-items/unique-magic-weapons/ray-gun)) require a near exact matching weapon to fire back.
