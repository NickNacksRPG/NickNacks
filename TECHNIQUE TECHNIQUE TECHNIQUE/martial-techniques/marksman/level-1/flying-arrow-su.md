Make a ranged attack against a creature that gains a mind of its own. It ignores all conventional rules of weaponry and continues to follow where you aim your weapon until it strikes an additional creature within 30 ft of the original. Secondary attacks ignore range increment penalties if the first did.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, deal an additional d8 (4) dmg and the projectile flies to attack an additional target.
