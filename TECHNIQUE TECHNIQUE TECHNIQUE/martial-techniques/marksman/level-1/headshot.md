Carefully line up a shot on a creature you specify. At the start of your next turn, shoot them as a free action with a +10 bonus to attack and a bonus 2d8 (9) damage.

If the creature takes cover or you are otherwise made unable to fire, this attack fails. This shot you take has effectively infinite range, only the initial targeting requires the creature be within 120 ft.
