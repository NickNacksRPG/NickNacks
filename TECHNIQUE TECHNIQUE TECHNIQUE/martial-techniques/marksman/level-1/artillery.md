While this technique is memorized, all ranged weapons you wield become long range weapons (60/120). If it already is a long range weapon, increase the range increments by 20.

You cannot benefit from this technique is you move more than 10 ft during your turn. If you benefit from this range increase before you move, your movement is reduced to 10 ft (applying speed debuffs like knockdown to this new 10 speed).
