Make a disarm attack with a +4 bonus against with a ranged weapon. If successful, the disarmed item continues flying along with the projectile until it lands, either in a surface, or in the ground at the end of its range. It requires a swift action to yank it free.

You can also use this technique against unattended objects for a similar effect.
