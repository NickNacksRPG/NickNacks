Fire a single powerful shot, targeting a 60-ft line in front of you and dealing 3d8+lvl (13+lvl) pierce damage (reflex halves).

If you increase the cast time of this ability to a FRA, gain +2 to its DC.

This technique automatically loads your weapon, and it automatically reloads it again after use.

<mark style="color:orange;">High Ground</mark> - The line attack adjusts it angle, allowing you to change its direction once right before it hits the ground (essentially allowing you to pick a location for the line attack to begin against the ground).

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, deal an additional d8 (4) dmg and increase the line by 10 ft.
