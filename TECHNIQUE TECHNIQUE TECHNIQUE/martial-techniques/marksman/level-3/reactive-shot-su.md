Mark an area with a glowing circle. Until the end of your next turn, you can automatically make a simple ranged attack against any creature that moves into, within or out of the area. Such attacks deal an additional 2d8 (9) dmg. You can make up to three attacks against three different creatures.

The attacks must still be within range of a ranged weapon you wield.

<mark style="color:orange;">High Ground</mark> - Attacks are made with a +2 bonus.
