Fire an arrow that deals an additional 2d8 (9) damage and embed it into a key spot on the targets body on hit with a variety of effects.

<mark style="color:green;">Hand</mark> - Creatures suffers a -2 penalty to attack using weapons/casting spells through that hand while the arrow remains.\
<mark style="color:green;">Leg</mark> - Creatures land speed is reduced by 15 and it cannot dash, jump or charge while the arrow remains.\
<mark style="color:green;">Etc</mark> - You can target other regions of a creature's body, such as their jaw, or a tentacle to apply the -2 attack penalty to that attack specifically, or a wing/fin to restrict the movement of a swimming or flying creature.

The arrow can be removed as a standard action without issue. It can be removed as a swift action by taking 2d8 (9) true damage. If you have medicine proficiency, removing as a swift action deals no damage.
