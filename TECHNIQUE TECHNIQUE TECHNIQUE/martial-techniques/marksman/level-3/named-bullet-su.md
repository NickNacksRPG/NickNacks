<table><thead><tr><th width="161">Effect</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Target</td><td>1 piece of ammunition</td></tr></tbody></table>

Hold a piece of ammunition (not just a bullet) in your hand and infuse it with your conviction to defeat a specific enemy. You must know the creatures name. If you use an incorrect name, when you fire the shot, it has no added effect.

You get a +10 bonus to attack with a piece of ammunition affected by named bullet.

While this ammunition holds this power, you are afflicted with \[mana burn] 3. This does not go away on rest. This mana burn becomes permanent if you fire the shot.

You can spend 1 minute to diffuse the power of this ammunition, removing the effects of named bullet from it and removing the mana burn. You can do this regardless of distance from it. You cannot diffuse a named bullet's power after you have already fired it.
