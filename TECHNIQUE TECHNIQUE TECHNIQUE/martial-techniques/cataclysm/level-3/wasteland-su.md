You use the ink to inscribe the mark of the Cataclysm on a flat surface. Over the course of a week, the curse will spread over the area of the spell. Plants will wither, soil will turn to sand or dust, water sources will dry up and wildlife will perish. In general, the natural terrain suffers until it is converted into uninhabitable wasteland over the course of a year, and a toxic volcanic wasteland over a decade.

To remove the curse, a creature must spend 200g of summoner's ink or normal ink made with holy water to write a brief poem or prayer in druidic in a circle around the mark of the Cataclysm. Depending on how long the mark was present, it may take years for the land to recover without assistance.
