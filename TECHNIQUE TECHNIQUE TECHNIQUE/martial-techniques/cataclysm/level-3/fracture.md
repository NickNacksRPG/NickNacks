On-hit or after grappling a foe, crack a creature's bones in one of their limbs in order to impede them and cause great pain. The creature takes 2d8 (9) true damage and has one of their limbs rendered useless (fort halves damage and turns damaged limb into stagger for 1 round).

<mark style="color:green;">Arm</mark> - Creature is unable to use arm

<mark style="color:green;">Leg</mark> - Creatures speed is reduced by 15. Clumsy 1 permanently.

<mark style="color:green;">Wing</mark> - Creature is unable to fly.

{% hint style="info" %}
Other limbs can be selected, disabling natural attacks like tentacles and such. These are just the most common examples.
{% endhint %}

The damaged limb can be healed with a DC 25 medicine check, taking 1 minute. It can also be healed by restoring to full hp.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d8 (4).
