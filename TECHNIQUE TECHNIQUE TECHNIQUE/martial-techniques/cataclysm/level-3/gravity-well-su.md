Flex so hard you exert a weak gravitational force around you. All creatures within 60 ft are grounded. This debuff persists for the rest of the affected creature's turn after leaving the area.

As a swift action, you can end the effect and pull all creatures within range 30 ft closer to you (fort negates).
