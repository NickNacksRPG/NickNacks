Your devotion manifests into gifts from your fiendish patron. Get a +2 bonus to athletics checks and damage made with unarmed strikes and natural attacks.

As part of using this technique, you must make a DC 15 athletics check to break a handheld object, like an apple, a hammer or a trumpet. If you fail, the buff immediately ends.
