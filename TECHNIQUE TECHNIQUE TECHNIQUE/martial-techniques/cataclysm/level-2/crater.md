{% hint style="info" %}
You must have high ground on your opponent to use this technique. A jump is sufficient to meet this criteria.
{% endhint %}

Slam your opponent into the ground with such force that the ground underneath you cracks and splinters upwards, dealing an additional d8 (4) dmg. A 10 ft radius circular wall of earth forms with you and your opponent at the center inside. The wall is 20 ft tall on the inside and 10 on the outside.

A creature can break through the wall with an athletics check as a standard action. You can break through it as a free action (1/turn) with a successful athletics check.

If you or your opponent is larger than medium, than the walls radius increases by 5ft per size category above medium.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional point of mana spent, deal an additional d8 (4) dmg and increase the DC of destroying the wall by 2.
