Call upon your fiendish patron and punch the ground. An enormous fiendish fist appears above your target and slams down upon them. \
This can have 2 different effects...

Make a melee attack, with a "cast time" of a special attack. This functions as though you were making a melee attack, but it has greatly increased range, deals an additional d8 (4) dmg and an equal amount of poise damage. If this poise breaks, it knocks the creature down. If the creature was flying, they are sent down to the ground in addition any other effects on hit.&#x20;

or

Let the patron do all the work as a standard action. The targeted creature takes 3d8+lvl (13+lvl) crush damage and is sent down to the ground if flying (reflex halves dmg and negates grounding). The target also takes poise damage equal to damage dealt.  If this poise breaks, it knocks the creature down.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - Deals an additional d8 (4) damage per mana spent. If you spend at least 4 mana, the technique's range increases to 60 ft.
