You make an unarmed strike or natural attack against a creature, aiming straight for the abdomen while shouting "GUT CHECK." The attack does an additional d8 (4) dmg and on hit if the creature has just swallowed something recently, they vomit it out, negating its benefits or drawbacks.

Also ends pregnancies (fort negates).

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional point of mana spent, deal an additional d8 (4) dmg. If you spend at least 4 mana, the creature is also sickened 1, and cannot consume anything without getting rid of the sickened first.
