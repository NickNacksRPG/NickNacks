# ðŸŒ‹ Cataclysm

Caldera the Cataclysm is a demon lord that respects raw physical strength over all else. Her followers regularly engage in contests to prove who has the most. People fear to speak her name or draw her ire and have the cataclysm fall upon them. She has reached the pinnacle of physical strength, giving her the ability to control gravity itself and literally bend physics to her will.

Cataclysm spells are centered around increasing and utilizing raw physical strength, manipulating gravity, causing immense destruction and being incredibly loud.
