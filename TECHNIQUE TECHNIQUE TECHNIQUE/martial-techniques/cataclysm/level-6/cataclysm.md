You call forth the infinite reserves of strength possessed by your fiendish patron to lay waste to the area around you. It requires a standard action to initiate this technique and you immediately leap 5,000 feet into the air. You are still targetable through normal means, but the distance makes most forms of attack impossible. Until the start of your next turn you charge energy and gain momentum as you plummet towards the ground. To onlookers you look like a meteor rapidly approaching.

As a standard action on your next turn, you decide the area you want to unleash this gathered momentum and energy. Choose a 60 ft line in the technique's range. All but the sturdiest objects (adamantine toughness+) within 30 feet of this line are immediately evaporated by your impact, turning to dust. Creatures within 30 feet of this line take 50 bludgeoning damage, are knocked out of the area and are staggered for 1 minute (fort halves the damage and lowers the staggered duration to 1 round). New save every round to end stagger. You end the movement granted by this technique at the end of this line.

The area within 30 feet on either side of this line becomes a 30 ft deep pit of roiling [liquid magma](https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/environmental-hazards/lava) that persists for weeks, or even longer depending on environmental conditions.

This technique is anything but subtle and leaves a lot to be desired when using it as a surprise attack. The impact creates an incredibly powerful shockwave that people might mistake for an earthquake. Objects such as buildings, trees and roads close by to the where this technique is cast are damaged by being in the vicinity of this impact, even if they aren't in the lava crater.
