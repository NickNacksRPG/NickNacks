You channel your power such that it forces everything nearby to bend to your might. You passively exert a tangible gravitational pull to everything within 60 ft, causing loose objects weighing less than 100 lbs to immediately be pulled into the storm, throwing them into an orbit around you. Loose objects weighing between 100 and 1000 lbs are slowly dragged towards you.

As part of using this technique, and at the start of every turn as a free action, you can choose to exert this force, pulling all creatures in range 10 ft closer to you. Any movement within 60 ft of you that isnâ€™t moving directly towards you is considered difficult terrain. Creatures within range can hover or fly and immediately take appropriate fall damage if they enter your gravity aura.

At the end of each of your turns, if a creature is within your natural reach, it must roll a DC 20 athletics check or buckled under its own weight and brought to its knees, causing it to take 4d6 (14) crush dmg and gain clumsy 1.
