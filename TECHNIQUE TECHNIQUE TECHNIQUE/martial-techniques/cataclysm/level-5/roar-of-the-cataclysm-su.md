You call forth a portion of your fiendish patron to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.  The visage of your fiendish patron overlaps your own as you let out a monstrous roar.&#x20;

Creatures within 30 feet of you take 6d6 (21) sonic damage. They are also frightened for 1 minute (will reduces frightened to shaken 1). Each round at the end of their turn, creatures can roll another save to reduce the frightened condition to shaken 1.
