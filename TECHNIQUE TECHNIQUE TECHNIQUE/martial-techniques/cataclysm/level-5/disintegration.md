Attack with such violent force that the target is evaporated. Roll a melee attack and on-hit the target starts to disintegrate (fort reduced duration to 1 round). Disintegrating creatures take 5d6 (17) true damage at the start of each turn and are staggered. Creatures defeated by this damage are turned to dust.

If you target an object, you can evaporate a 5x5x5 ft cube matter of solid or lesser toughness, turning it to dust. Tougher objects sustain heavy damage in the same area.
