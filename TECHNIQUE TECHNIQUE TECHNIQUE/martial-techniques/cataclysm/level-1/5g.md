Increase the effects of gravity on your body, causing you to stay firmly planted on the ground, sometimes to your detriment.

You cannot hover or fly. You gain advantage on any save that would physically move you from your position or knock you down. Creatures have disadvantage on attacks made against you that would move you from your position or knock you down.

If used underwater, you sink to the bottom 60 ft per round.
