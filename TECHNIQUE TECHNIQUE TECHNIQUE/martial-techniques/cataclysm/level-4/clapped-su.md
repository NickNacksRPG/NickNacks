You call forth a portion of your fiendish patron to crush your enemies. Two muscular arms overlap your own as you clap a foe within range.

Make two unarmed melee attack rolls against a creature with a +2 bonus. Each attack deals 4d8 (18) crush damage. Creatures hit by at least one attack are dazed for 1 round (fort negates). Creatures hit by both strikes are stunned for 1 round (fort negates).
