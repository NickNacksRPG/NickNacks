<table><thead><tr><th width="161">Effect</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Range</td><td>Reach</td></tr><tr><td>Target</td><td>1 creature</td></tr><tr><td>Duration</td><td>3 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>Save</td><td>Fort</td></tr></tbody></table>

Strike at a creature's tendons dealing an additional 4d8 (18) dmg and to cause movement to hurt them. For every 5 feet they move, they take 2 true damage (fort negates). If the target is DD, this has no save.

Certain effects like teleportation, telekinetic movement or anything else not based on physical locomotion can bypass this effect.

This wound can be healed with a DC 25 medicine check using first aid, or by succeeding on a DC 25 CL check with a healing spell/effect.
