Knock yourself down and roll disguise/stealth with a +2 bonus. The nearest creature rolls perception against you to determine if you're down for the count and everybody else takes their assessment as fact. You lose the knockdown status at the start of your next turn and your next attack against a creature makes them DD.

This ability only works once each combat. Creatures that have seen you do it in other combats get advantage on their perception.
