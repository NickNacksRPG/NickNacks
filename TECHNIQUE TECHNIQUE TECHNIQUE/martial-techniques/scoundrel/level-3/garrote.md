Make a grapple attack with a +4 bonus that also makes them bleed for 2d6 (7) if successful. While grappled your target is also silenced and cannot remove the bleed.

You do not need to spend any actions to maintain this grapple. Your drag attacks automatically succeed against them while grappled. This resets the creatures poise.
