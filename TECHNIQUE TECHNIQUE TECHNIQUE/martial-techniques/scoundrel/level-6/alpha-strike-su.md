You can choose to vanish when affected by any type of effect originating from a creature that you can see within range. At the end of the target's turn, you rapidly teleport and make melee attacks against them and up to 3 other creatures within 30 ft, each dealing an additional 4d6 (14) dmg. You end this flurry adjacent to original target.
