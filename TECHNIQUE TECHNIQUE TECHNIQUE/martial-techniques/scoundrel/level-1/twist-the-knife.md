If after your melee attack is resolved, if your opponent has 5 or less hp, you can tell. You can finish them off, automatically setting them to 0 hp, and then move 20 ft.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - Increase the health threshold by 5 per additional mana spent, also allowing you to detect if a creature you strike falls below this higher threshold.
