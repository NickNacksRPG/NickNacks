Shove a creature with a +4 bonus. If successful, you can continue to move in a straight line while pushing them until you run out of movement, then push them your shove distance.

If you impact another creature along your movement, you can attempt to shove them too. If you fail, your movement is halted. You and the original creature you rushed stop adjacent to the target you failed to shove.
