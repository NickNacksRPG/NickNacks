Toss your weapon, temporarily giving it the thrown property.

If it is a piercing weapon, it entangles the foe on hit. The creature can roll an athletics check (Class DC) to remove it as a swift action, or remove it automatically by spending a standard action.

When you throw the weapon, a copy of it appears in your hand, hit or miss. The weapon you throw disappears on a miss or after it is removed.
