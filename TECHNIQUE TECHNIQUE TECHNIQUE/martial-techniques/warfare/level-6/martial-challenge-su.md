Swing your weapon around you with such force that it flings all nearby enemies away from you. All enemies within 30 ft take 10d8 (45) slashing damage and are pushed directly away from you until they are 35 feet away from you (reflex halves damage and negates push back).

You can decide to not push one target in particular.

After the swipe, a visible barrier forms around you. Until the start of your next turn, you are immune to all damage that does not originate from a creature within 30 feet of you.
