A prototypical target appears on your back, and on your head. Enemies with range are taunted by you (will negates). Taunted creatures get an additional save at the end of their turn.

Mindless creatures and creatures of animal intelligence take a -2 penalty to their save. Creatures in the aura take a -10 penalty to perception checks versus anything that isnâ€™t the targeted creature (even if they pass their save).

A creature that is the target of this technique cannot be target by it again for 1 minute.
