Create a portal that brings you to your own private dimension (aka demiplane). The first time you go to this dimension, it is empty, and the tuning fork used as the focus attunes to this plane. Every time you cast this spell after the first, you come back to this dimension.

The range, concentration and teleportation aspects of this spell refer to the portal you create to get to your inner sanctum. The portal acts as a window between the 2 dimensions, and stays open as long as you concentrate. Whenever you exit your inner sanctum, you always appear from where you entered it.

The sanctum itself is a large empty void filled with a dark clay-like substance. Using your mind alone, you can form this clay into the shape of anything you like, such as furniture, statues, trees etc. This substance always has a texture of sturdy but malleable clay. It cannot create living things or complex objects like clocks, only facsimiles of such things. The substance always has a dark, almost space-like color to it. You cannot bring this substance out of your sanctum, but you can freely bring real objects in and out of it.

The sanctum's dimensions are 100x100x100 ft.
