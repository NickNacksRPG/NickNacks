Tear apart time in space surrounding a creature, causing the creature to temporarily split into two different versions of itself. One is clearly insubstantial, almost like a ghost, and gets yanked into a space of your choosing within range.

Targeting this severed spirit, in all ways, is treated as though you were affecting the original creature, using all of its statistics. \[Persistent] effects can still only effect once per turn, and AoE effects that target both still only do one instance of damage, but it gives the creature disadvantage on its save.

The spirit cannot be moved. It cannot be affected by anything other than HP damage, which is redirected to the original target of this spell. It cannot use any abilities and the original creature cannot activate its own abilities through its spirit. The target of the spell is tethered, and cannot ever be more than 120 ft from its spirit.
