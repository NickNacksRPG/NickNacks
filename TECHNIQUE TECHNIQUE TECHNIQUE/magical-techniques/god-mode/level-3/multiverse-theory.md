You call out into the multiverse your own name, and you answer the call. A version of yourself from an alternate timeline appears before you to speak to you or aid you with tasks. This alternate version of you does not have access to its mana pool, cannot attack and has 5 hp.&#x20;

The primary use of this spell is to give you a different perspective on things. It can give you a +2 bonus to skill checks, as though using the aid action, and it can do simple item interactions, such as pulling levers or lifting things. Because of how different your dimension is from theirs, they cannot perform tasks on their own.&#x20;

If this alternate version of yourself ever takes damage, you also take that damage, ignoring any temp hp you have. If the alternate you is out of your sight for longer than a minute, it disappears.

If you cast this spell again, the previous alternate you disappears.
