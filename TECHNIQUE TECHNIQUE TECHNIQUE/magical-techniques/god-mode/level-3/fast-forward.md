<table><thead><tr><th width="161">Effect</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Range</td><td>60 ft</td></tr><tr><td>Target</td><td>1 creature</td></tr></tbody></table>

The creature you target moves at incredible speed, allowing them to immediately take an additional turn. This does not affect their position in initiative.

On the creatures next turn they are dazed.

A creature cannot be the target of this spell for 1 minute after being affected by it.

The magic of this spell is a bit unstable and can sometimes go overboard. After the daze ends, an affected creature must make a DC 8 luck check or age 1 year.
