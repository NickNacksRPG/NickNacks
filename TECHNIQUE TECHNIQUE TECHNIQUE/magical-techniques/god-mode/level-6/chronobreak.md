While this technique is prepared a ghostly afterimage of yourself mimics your actions and movement, but at a delay of several seconds.

At any point while you can take standard actions, you can choose to revert back to the time your afterimage represents. You return back to the position you were in at the beginning of your last turn.

When you do, you burst in magical force, dealing 7d8+CL (31+CL) force damage to all enemies (reflex halves). You also restore 3d8+CL (13+CL) hp and cleanse all non-permanent status effects.

{% hint style="success" %}
I recommend using a token to refer to the position you were in, updating it at the start of each of your turns.
