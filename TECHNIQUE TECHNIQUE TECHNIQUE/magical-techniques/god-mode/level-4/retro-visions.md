You gaze into the past of the location you stand. You can make weeks, months, or even years pass by within minutes, but you always intuitively have a sense of how far back into the past are. You can see and hear events as they occurred. Things that are visually striking or loud are blips on your radar that give pause and allow you to watch in real time. Otherwise you need to have a roundabout idea of when the event happened.

The radius of the spell represents how far you can move around while observing.

You can freely travel (CL\*5) years back into the past looking for anomalies. If you have the exact date of an event, you can go twice as far back.
