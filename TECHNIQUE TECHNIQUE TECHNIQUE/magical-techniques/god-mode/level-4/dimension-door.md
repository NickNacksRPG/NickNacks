Touch a mostly flat solid surface and cause a incomplete portal to appear on it. At any point after as a standard action, you can touch another solid surface within 120 feet of the original and turn the portal on. For as long as you concentrate, creatures can walk into one portal and appear out of the other.

You can see through the portal as though it were a window leading to its destination.
