Cause time to stop almost completely for all creatures other than you. Everything else in the universe is essentially in [stasis](https://app.gitbook.com/s/1UhIURz1UgUHbhhsNrtV/the-rules/publish-your-docs-6) until this effect ends. You can spend a standard action to move an unattended object you would normally be able to manipulate (with great difficulty), but other than that, your options are limited for what to do with your extra turn.
