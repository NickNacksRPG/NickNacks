A golden chain is launched from your staff and wraps around a creature (reflex negates). While chained the creature cannot easily move beyond the spell's range and is clumsy 2.

As a swift action, the creature can attempt an opposed athletics check to drag you along with them. If you are untrained in athletics, use your CL as your bonus. If they succeed, you are pulled towards them the distance they move beyond the spells range (max 30 ft) and take 10 poise damage. If this poise breaks you, you are knocked down.

You can also attempt this athletics check to yank the creature back.
