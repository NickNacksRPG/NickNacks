You generate a portal that leads to the demon realm for 1 minute. A maximum of a dozen creatures can go through the portal. At any point within the next 24 hours, you can spend another minute to recreate this portal to bring you back to your original position. The portal’s destination is always on stable ground in an area without any immediate natural hazards (you don’t spawn in lava pits).

You must have an idea of where you would like to go in order to use this spell. Roll a planes check and subtract your result from 40. That is how many miles you appear off course from your desired location. The minimum distance is 1 mile off course.

If you are interrupted during the cast time when attempting to recreate the portal or you stay for longer than 24 hours, you cannot use this spell to return back to the material plane and must find other means.

This spell does not require line of sight.
