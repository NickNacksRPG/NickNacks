You fill a creatures mind with horny thoughts, causing them to shiver and writhe with pleasure. The creature is dazed for 1 round and staggered the round after (will reduces to stagger 1 round).

If the target creature could reasonably be sexually attracted to the caster (aka, not gay) then the DC is increased by 1. If the caster is naked, or basically naked, the DC is increased by 1. These DC increases stack.

A creature can only be targeted by a spell that makes them horny once every few minutes.
