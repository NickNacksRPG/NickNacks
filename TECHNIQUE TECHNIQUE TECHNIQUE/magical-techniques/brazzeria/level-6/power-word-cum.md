You fill a creatures mind with horny thoughts, causing them to shiver and writhe with pleasure. The extent of which this affects them is determined by whether or not the creature is attracted to you.

If the target creature could reasonably be sexually attracted to the caster (aka, different gender and not gay) then the creature is stunned for 1 round, then staggered the round after.

If the creature isn't compatible (same gender and not gay etc) or doesn't experience horny (like mindless creatures and constructs) then it is staggered for 1 round.

A creature can only be targeted by a spell that makes them horny once every few minutes.
