# Brazzeria

Brazzeria embodies the struggle people face when their beliefs clash with reality and their desires clash with their duties.  She has a reputation for normalizing what would otherwise be considered taboo in most other types of relationships.  In the eyes of her followers, almost no evil is too great to be beyond redemption.  As such, it isnâ€™t uncommon to find her followers frequenting the same place as fiends on the material plane.  It is a constant battle of wills; satisfying your deepest desires while avoiding the descent into deepest depths of profanity.

Brazzeria spells are a mix between useful spells for battling fiends, healing and horny spells.
