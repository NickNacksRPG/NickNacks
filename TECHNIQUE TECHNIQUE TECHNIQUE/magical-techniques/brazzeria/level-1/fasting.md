You lock the creature out from all kinds of physical intimacy. The target is physically unable to engage in intimate touch as a divine force repels all attempts to initiate such acts, as well as all attempts made against the target to initiate such acts. No other bodily functions are impaired by this spell.

Any effects that have a saving throw and can be obviously considered lewd are rolled with advantage.

When the spell is cast, a magical key is generated. Inserting this key into the chest of the corresponding creature is the only reliable way to end this spell (donâ€™t lose it!). If the key is destroyed, they spell ends.
