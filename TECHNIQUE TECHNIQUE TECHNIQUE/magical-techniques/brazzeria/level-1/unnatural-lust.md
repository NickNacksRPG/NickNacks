When you cast the spell, you choose two targets. The initial target you inflict the horny upon. The second target doesn't get affected by anything, but rather determines where this horniness is directed towards. The initial target must spend the entirety of its next turn moving towards the secondary target and then caressing, hugging, or kissing them (will negates).

A creature gets a +4 to its save if it would not normally be sexually attracted to the secondary target. By succeeding on a monster lore check against a creature, you can determine what an appropriate secondary target for this spell would be.

After failing its save and satisfying it's carnal desires, a creature becomes more resistant to the spell and always receives the +4 bonus on subsequent casts against it for one minute.

A creature can only be targeted by a spell that makes them horny once every few minutes.
