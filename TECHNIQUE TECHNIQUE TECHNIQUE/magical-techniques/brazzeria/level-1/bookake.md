You apply the mark of Brazzeria and close the book. Between its pages ooze an incredibly effective gooey adhesive that keeps it closed. No matter how strong the individual, the book's adhesive may stretch slightly, but it cannot be broken open. You can also choose to seal off only a specific section of a book, such as a chapter or a singular page. The caster must apply a password to the book that dispels the goo when spoken.&#x20;

A caster may roll arcana to determine the password (15+CL). An application of universal solvent automatically dispels this effect.
