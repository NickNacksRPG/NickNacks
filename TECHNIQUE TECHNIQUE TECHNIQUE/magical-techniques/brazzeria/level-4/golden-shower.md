A fluffy yellow cloud appears 30 ft overhead and soothing droplets of gold rain wash over nearby allies, and burn nearby enemies. All allied creatures recover 4 hp each turn and all enemies take 4 holy damage each turn for 1 minute (totaling 40 healing or damage over the full duration).

This healing/dmg occurs at the end of each of your turns. If an enemy is defeated, they cannot die from this damage, and they no longer take holy damage from the rain.
