You conjure a golden spectral champion of Brazzeria that mirrors your movements and enhances your actions. Whenever you target allies with a beneficial effect, you can choose to also heal them (or one of them for AoE effects) for d4+CL (2+CL), or 2d6+CL (7+CL) if they are within your natural reach.&#x20;

Whenever you target an enemy with a harmful effect, you can choose to also strike them with holy energy (or one of them for AoE effects), dealing d4+CL (2+CL) holy dmg, or 2d6+CL (7+CL) holy damage if they are within your natural reach.

Either effect requires a swift action, and can be performed as part of casting this spell.

The spirit will also protect you in your hour of need. If you fail a will save, you can choose to instead pass. If you are defeated, you can instead choose to drop to 1 hp. Either effect requires an immediate action and ends the spell.
