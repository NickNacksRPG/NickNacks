You move around to inscribe a circle on the ground, then infuse it with mana to cause a tangible but transparent barrier to appear, sealing the fiend inside of it. The fiend is unable to pass through this barrier, or go under/over it. It is anchored and siphoned while inside. Otherwise the fiend may act as they wish.&#x20;

If the barrier is ever damaged from the outside, it automatically breaks, and so care must be taken to protect trapped demons. Brazzerians usually use this spell to interact with the fiend to get to know them better to prepare for [purification](https://app.gitbook.com/s/qFzTamwcoNEgFoEbLz7c/gods/heavenly-deities/brazzeria/brazzerian-purification).

This spell functions only on level 4 or lower fiends.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - Each additional mana spent increases the level of the fiend you can trap by 2 (max 12).
