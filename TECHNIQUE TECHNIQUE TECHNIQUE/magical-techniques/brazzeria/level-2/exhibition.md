This spell functions differently if you target an ally or an enemy.

<mark style="color:orange;">Enemy</mark>\
You cause all of the creatures equipment to visually disappear, making them appear naked (will negates). For the duration of the spell the creature treats it as though they have no equipment, and cannot use anything dependent on equipment, such as shield actions, spell casting and weapon special attacks. At the end of each turn, the creature gets a new save to end the effect.

They still get any passive bonuses to their equipment, such as armor or poise from shields.

<mark style="color:orange;">Ally</mark>\
You can cast this spell on yourself or an ally as a swift action, and its duration increases to 1 hour. It instead only makes your ally appear as though they are naked or scantily clad, but still armed. They can still use any activated equipment.
