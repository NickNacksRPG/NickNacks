You inflict the curse of the simp on a defeated or willing creature. The creature is permanently charmed. All interactions between you and the creature are inherently positive to the creature. Stepping on them is a massage, insulting them is advice etc. When the creature is asked about you, they have nothing but positive things to say and you can do no wrong.

While they are not compelled to do anything that you ask necessarily, they do go out of their way to help in ways that donâ€™t require much effort on their part, and they are very easy to convince. You get advantage on any skill check versus this creature.

If you affect the creature with an effect that deals damage or otherwise harms them, then they get a will save against the curse (also applies if they see/find out you told someone else to do so).

Doing an advanced ritual that involves going outside and touching grass, the curse ends.
