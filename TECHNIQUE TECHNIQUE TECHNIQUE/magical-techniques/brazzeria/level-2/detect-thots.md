You detect thots. For the purposes of this spell, a thot is someone who (breathes) has had more than one sexual partner. Every turn as a standard action you can scan a creature you can see, automatically telling you their propensity for horniness on a scale of 1 to 5.

You can also pry further to find out a rough approximation of the number of sexual partners the target has had (will negates).

Rough estimation: Zero, one, several, dozens, countless
