You roll a caster level check to immediately end a polymorph effect. The DC is (11+CL of the effect) or for non-spell effects (11+creature's lvl). If you are successful, the creature is staggered for one round and cannot use polymorph effects for 24 hours.

If you cast this on a creature that is not currently hiding its true form, the spell rebounds and you stagger yourself for 1 round. If you cast this on a helpless or willing creature, it automatically succeeds.

When used against a fiendish creature, increase your effective caster level by 5.
