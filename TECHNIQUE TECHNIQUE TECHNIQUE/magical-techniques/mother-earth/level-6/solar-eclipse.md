You alter the composition of the heavens in such a way to mimic the effect of a solar eclipse. All creatures caught in the radius of the spell when it is first cast without proper eye protection are blinded for the duration of the spell (reflex reduces to 1 round). Creatures in the spells radius take a -4 penalty on perception even if they aren't blinded.

What constitutes protection either covers the eyes completely, or are glasses specifically designed to block the powerful light of the eclipse. The caster can create a pair of these glasses for 100g.

Solar eclipse ends automatically if lunar eclipse is cast in its range, cancelling each other out.

All weather inducing spells do not function underground.
