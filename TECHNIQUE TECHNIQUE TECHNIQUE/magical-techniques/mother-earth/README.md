# Mother Earth

The oldest of all the deities and the creator goddess. Mother Earth is interested in the constant struggle between nature and those who would seek its destruction or exploitation. The proliferation of life and balance between all living things are what her followers preach.

Mother Earth spells primarily manipulate plants, animals and other aspects of nature to aid those who seek to protect it.
