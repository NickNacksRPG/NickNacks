You summon a group of playful fairies that fly around the battlefield and bother your enemies. They do not have any hp, but they do have 25+CL poise. If they are ever poise broken, they disappear.

On your turn they can fly up to 30 feet and make a combat maneuver against a creature. The result of the combat maneuver is always 20+CL. You can direct them to focus on specific creatures.
