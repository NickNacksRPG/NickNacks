Transform into a young living tree, a large shrub or dead tree. The type of tree, as well as its appearance, is under your control. While in tree form, you can observe the world around you just as if you were in your normal form. You can dismiss tree shape as a free action.

You get a +10 bonus to stealth/disguise while in tree form and can use either skill to evade detection, otherwise people will think something is fishy about this tree. You cannot move or take any actions while in tree form, but you can speak.
