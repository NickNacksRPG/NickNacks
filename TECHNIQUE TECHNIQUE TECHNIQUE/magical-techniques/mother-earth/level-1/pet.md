You reach over to a creature and pat its head. If it resembles an animal, even superficially, it is dazed on hit for 1 turn.

If it is a defeated creature that matches this description, it gets the time out condition for 1 hour.

Tamed animals (such as beast companions) can be brought back from pet heaven with a counter pet as a swift action.
