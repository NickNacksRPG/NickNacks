<table><thead><tr><th width="161">Effect</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Range</td><td>30 ft</td></tr><tr><td>Target</td><td>1 unoccupied space</td></tr><tr><td>Duration</td><td>1 minute</td></tr></tbody></table>

You cause a bunch of tall grass to spring up. This space is overgrown and is considered difficult terrain. It also provides cover to any attacks made into or through it.

You can take the hide action in this bush as a free action the turn you cast this spell.

The bush withers and fades after 1 minute, or 3 rounds if the environment couldn't otherwise sustain it.
