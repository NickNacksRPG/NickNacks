This spell can be used by creatures hoping to change themselves.

After the cast time completes, the creature falls unconscious to dream about its new self as a cocoon forms around them. 24 hours pass and they awaken in their new form. The creature can change its race, its gender and its physical appearance to its liking. The creature has complete control over all features such as racial traits, height, age, skin color etc as long as it falls within reasonable parameters for the race.

If the cocoon is destroyed, the spell fails and the creature inside is killed..
