Shower a foe with seeds that take root inside of their skin (reflex negates). At the end of your turn, they take (CL+5) necrotic damage and you recover hp equal to the damage if you are within 30 ft. As an immediate action, you can divert the flow of energy to bestow this healing upon another creature within 30 ft of you.

If neither you nor an ally is within 30 ft of the seeded creature, the damage does not occur.
