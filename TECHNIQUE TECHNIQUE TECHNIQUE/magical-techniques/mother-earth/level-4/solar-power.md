Special: This spell can only be cast during the day with access to the open sky.
{% endhint %}

During the initial turn you cast this spell, you accumulate energy from the sun. On the following turn, choose one to do as a standard actionâ€¦

<mark style="color:green;">Solar Blade</mark> - Make a melee attack with a +2 bonus. It does 5d8+CL (22+CL) fire damage.

<mark style="color:green;">Solar Beam</mark> - Target a 60 ft line that is 15 ft wide with 5d6+CL (17+CL) fire damage (reflex halves). The DC is 2 higher. Rather than damage plants, it invigorates them, curing fatigue.

If you are unable to take actions on the following turn, you lose the charge.

This spell cannot be cast in any turn you fire a solar beam or attack with a solar blade.
