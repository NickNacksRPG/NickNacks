{% hint style="info" %}
This spell can only be cast in a densely forested area (such as a rainforest or woodland).
{% endhint %}

You enter a trance while you slowly become one with nature over the cast time. Once you have completed the cast time, your spirit separates from your body and it is free to wander and explore. While wandering your body is effectively stunned. If you take damage or are hit with a harmful effect, the trance ends.

There is no limit on on how long you can remain in this trance, but staying in for many hours leaves your body hungry and tired. While in spirit form you have a sixth sense for detecting water sources and when the forest is being significantly damaged within the spells area. Someone cutting down a tree isn't enough to trigger this, but a large scale lumber organization cutting away is. When you detect one of these things, you can appear overhead to observe. Other creatures cannot see you unless they can also see invisible creatures or ghosts.

At any point, you can decide to speak. You can make your voice soft or loud and you make it seem to emanate all around the area, giving you advantage on intimidation. You can also cause any of the nearby creatures to exhibit any behavior natural to them, such as being completely silent, making noise or perching overhead. They won't engage dangerous situations at your request.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast 6</mark> - The AoE of the spell increases to 100 miles.
