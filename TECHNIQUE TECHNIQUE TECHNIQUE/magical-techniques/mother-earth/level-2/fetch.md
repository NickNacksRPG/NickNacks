You wiggle an object at a creature in range and toss it to a space within 30 feet of you. The creature must spend all of its actions to retrieve this object and bring it back to you (will negates). If you ever get more than 30 feet away from the object, you are no longer visible to the target or the creature successfully brings it back to you, the spell ends. If there is something that impedes the creature's movement, it can reasonably spend its actions dealing with this obstacle (a wall of sheep, creature is grappled etc).&#x20;

If the creature does not retrieve the item after the first turn, then it gets an additional save at the end of each of its turn to shake off the compulsion to fetch.

This spellâ€™s DC is 2 higher when targeting beasts.
