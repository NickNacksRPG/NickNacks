You launch a stream of ants that get your opponent MOVING (reflex reduces effect to 1 round). They take a (3+CL) pierce damage at the start of their turn. They must start each of their turns by moving 10 ft in a random direction. Being immersed or drenched in water, taking any AoE damage or something else suitable can reduce the duration of this spell or remove the ants completely. The ants automatically disperse if the foe is defeated.
