You summon a flock of sheep that quickly pile up on top of each other to form a fluffy impassable barrier. The sheep are completely impervious to all forms of attack unless it is a combat maneuver. The wall has 20 poise. When poise broken, a 5x5 section of the wall falls apart and the sheep disappear. If the creature who broke through the wall was larger, the hole is also large enough for them to fit (10x10 large, 15x15 huge etc).

In order to interact with the wall, it required maneuvering through the unruly sheep. To climb on the wall, it requires an athletics roll, to balance on it requires acrobatics etc (skill DC=caster's DC).
