You summon a swarm of bees that intuitively follow your orders without need for speech. The bees wonâ€™t enter water. You must maintain a tether to them using the swarm almost like an additional limb that if separated, immediately disappears.&#x20;

You take a -5 penalty to stealth checks and you have a hover speed of 30.

The bees hover around you and can perform a few sets of tasks...\
<mark style="color:green;">Interact (action varies)</mark> - The bees can perform tasks with a high degree of precision such as picking up objects and opening doors. They can perform any task you could perform with your hands (including skills like SoH) at a range of 20 feet&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Sting \[envenom] (standard)</mark> - Automatically deal (2+CL) pierce damage to a single creature within 10 feet. They are also staggered for 1 round (fort negates).

<mark style="color:green;">Protect (immediate)</mark> - The bees move to block an attack, giving you a +4 bonus to ac or +4 bonus to a reflex save. This subtracts 5 rounds from the duration of the spell
