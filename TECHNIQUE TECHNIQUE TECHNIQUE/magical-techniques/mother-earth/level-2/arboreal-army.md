All the nearby plants snap to attention, ready to receive orders. As a swift action each turn, you can command a nearby inanimate plant to bully a nearby creature by bending its trunk or swinging its branches. Its bonus is your CL. It gets advantage if the creature is currently inside of the attacking tree, bush etc.
