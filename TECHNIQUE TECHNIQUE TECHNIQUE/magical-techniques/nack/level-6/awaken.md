You give a plant or animal sentience. Its intelligence increases to +0. If it is a plant, it gains a 30ft speed and the ability to uproot without killing itself. If it is a beast, their type changes to magical beast. Creatures gain big goofy eyes and a mouth to speak with. They learn common.

What happens after that is largely based up to it. Certain types of creatures may have certain mannerisms. Predators tend to be more aggressive, for instance. Beavers are more industrious. They can look upon their past and present with great clarity, recognizing mistreatment and caring.

This spell has a 1 week cooldown.
