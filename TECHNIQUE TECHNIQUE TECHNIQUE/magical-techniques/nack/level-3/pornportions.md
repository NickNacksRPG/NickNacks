You cause a creature to have incredibly exaggerated proportions, focusing primarily on the sex characteristics. Women get incredibly curvy or impossibly thin, men get enormous members, or you can mix and match features of the creature to match a particular taste. This spell cannot give creatures parts they do not have, only alter the ones they do.

Get advantage on sex checks...If you roll that kind of thing.
