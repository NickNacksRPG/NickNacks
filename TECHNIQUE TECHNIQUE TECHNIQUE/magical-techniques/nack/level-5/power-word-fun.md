You temporarily and partially negate CC on yourself and nearby creatures. For creatures who are stunned, dazed, in stasis, in time out etc. This spell does not end the cc, but it allows creatures who are affected by them to do anything that could reasonably be considered "not mechanically beneficial" such as singing, dancing, juggling (unless these actions could somehow be mechanically beneficial) or casting a Nack spell. This does not allow movement, attacks, defensive features etc that you would normally be deprived of. This is a meme. If you try to anyway, you are put in time out until combat ends.

Any creature in range, regardless if they are CC'd, adds extra flair in all their actions, or emotes like they're in a video game. Even if they try not to, they can't help but bob their head and tap their feet.

The caster can immediately use any other Nack spell as a free action.
