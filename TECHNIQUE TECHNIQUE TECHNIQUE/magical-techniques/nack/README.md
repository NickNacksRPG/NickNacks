# Nack

{% hint style="info" %}
Special: Nack spells cannot be learned via technique points. They can only be learned by finding books containing their knowledge. When these books are read, you gain the spell as an at-will innate technique, and the book vanishes. Since the spell level is mostly irrelevant, it mostly just refers to the rarity.
{% endhint %}

Nack is a mysterious mage who uses his mastery in order to create mostly useless and niche magic. He also has enough free time to hide these books all over the world in secluded places. Very few of the spells are as powerful as one might expect of a mage, but they are usually interesting, quirky and fun. A mage with mastery over Nack spells is not more powerful because of it, but they're probably more fun to have at parties.
