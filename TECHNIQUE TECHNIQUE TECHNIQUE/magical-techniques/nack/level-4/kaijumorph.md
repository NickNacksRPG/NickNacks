You grow to be 100 ft tall, proportions changing as appropriate. This does not give you extra carry weight, strength, or destructive capabilities. It does not even increase your reach. You still possess the same exact weight.

If you are targeted with a harmful effect, take damage or cease concentration, you immediately shrink back to your normal size.
