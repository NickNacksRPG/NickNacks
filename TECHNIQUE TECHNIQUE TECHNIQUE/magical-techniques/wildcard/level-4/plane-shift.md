You concentrate for a minute on your destination, then appear in a location on another plane. The recipients of this spell must be in physical contact with each other.

You must have an idea of where you would like to go in order to use this spell. Roll a planes check and subtract your result from 40. That is how many miles you appear off course from your desired location. The minimum distance is 1 mile off course.

Tuning forks are made out of material native to the plane. They are difficult to obtain without first visiting that plane or purchasing them from specialized vendors.&#x20;

This spell does not require line of sight.
