This spell has a different effect depending on what you target.

<mark style="color:orange;">Ally</mark> - Creature shrinks down to the size of an action figure, only a few inches tall. It is unable to effectively damage creatures of small or larger size due to its diminutive nature. Their speed is reduced by 15. They can say "big mode" to increase back to their normal size as a standard action.

<mark style="color:orange;">Enemy</mark> - The creature shrinks to small size on-hit. If already small or smaller, no effect.

<mark style="color:orange;">Object</mark> - Targeting an unattended object shrinks it down to 1/10th of its original size. Divide its weight by 100.
