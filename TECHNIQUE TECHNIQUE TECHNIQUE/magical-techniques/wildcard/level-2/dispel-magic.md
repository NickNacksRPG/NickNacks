The spell can be used in two different ways.

<mark style="color:orange;">Dispel</mark> - You roll a caster level check to immediately end a magical effect. The DC is (11+CL of the effect).

<mark style="color:orange;">Counter Spell</mark> - You roll a caster level check to prevent a spell from being cast. This must be done as a prepared action in response to a spell being cast. The DC is (11+CL of the spell). If the spell the creature is casting has a higher caster level than your to dispel magic, you have disadvantage on your caster level check.

You can use dispel magic on supernatural features, labeled (Su). The creature's CL is treated as (lvl+2).\
Passive supernatural effects or constant innate spells can be reactivated as a standard action.
