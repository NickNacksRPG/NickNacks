You create an extradimensional space that can store numerous small items. When you gaze inside you see nothing but a starry sky. It creates a 5x5x5 ft space that can hold 100 lbs of items. The item need not fit into the entrance of the pocket/pouch, only the extra dimensional space. Any excess you attempt to put in spills back out immediately. As long as you know what you're looking for, you can effortlessly pull it out of the space without looking inside. If you turn the pouch/pocket inside out or this spell ends, all of the items spill out.

This spell can be made permanent by sewing phase spider web into the fabric (3k gold). You no longer need to prepare a permanent arcane pocket.

Any previous instance of this spell disappears if cast again.
