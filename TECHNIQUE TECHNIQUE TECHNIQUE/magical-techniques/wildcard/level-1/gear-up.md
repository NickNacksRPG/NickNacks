You create a magical copy of a non-magical shield or weapon that you think of that doesn't require ammunition, such as a dagger or greatsword. It deals force damage instead of its usual damage.

If you have an open hand, you can cause the weapon to appear in your hand and you can make a simple attack with it as part of casting the spell.

If you cast this spell while you have already conjured gear, the previous gear disappears.
