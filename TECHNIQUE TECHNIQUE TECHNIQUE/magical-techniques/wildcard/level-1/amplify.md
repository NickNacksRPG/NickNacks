The touched creature gains the ability to increase their volume much higher than what is normal. Good for getting the attention of crowds, shouting for lost friends and announcing for sports.

<mark style="color:orange;">Upcast 5</mark> - The spell doesn't increase your volume further, but rather allows your voice to carry extreme distances. You are capable of speaking to entire towns, large battlefields and small islands miles wide.
