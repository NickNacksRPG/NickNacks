Casting this spell allows the caster to jump as high and far as their movement speed. When you jump, you ignore fall damage from a fall of 30 ft or less. If you attack an enemy that is in midair during this time, your movement is \[elusive] when landing after jumping up to them.

As part of casting the spell, you can take the jump action.

<mark style="color:orange;">Upcast 2</mark> - You can increase the duration of the spell to 10 minutes, and it gains the \[buff] tag.
