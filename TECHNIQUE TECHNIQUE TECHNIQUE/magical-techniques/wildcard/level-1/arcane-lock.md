The spell can only be cast on medium (or smaller) sized objects, like a chest, an average door or a dresser.

A visible padlock appears on the object decorated with magic sigils, usually near the point where it needs to be opened. While the lock persists, the object cannot be opened.

As a standard action, a character can get rid of the lock and pop open the object with an athletics or sleight of hand check (DC 23).

Any previous instance of this spell disappears if cast again.
