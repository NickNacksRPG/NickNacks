<table><thead><tr><th width="161">Effect</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AoE</td><td>15 ft, centered on caster</td></tr></tbody></table>

The skies darken above you and tiny motes of light pepper the heavens.

You can call down stars on your foes. You automatically deal (CL) force damage to all enemies within 15 ft of you. Each time you hit an enemy with this spell, the damage increases by 3 for the next 2 rounds. Additional casts extend the duration of the increased damage, allowing it to ramp up in damage infinitely.

Damage resets when you roll initiative.
