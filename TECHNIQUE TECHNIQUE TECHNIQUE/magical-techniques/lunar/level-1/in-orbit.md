3 small pale white orbs emerge from your staff and float around you. At the end of each of your turns, an orb bumps into to a creature within your natural reach. A single creature can only be hit by 1 orb a turn, but can be affected by multiple over several turns.

When an orb bumps into a creature, it deals (3+CL) force damage and disappears. If multiple creatures are within your reach, multiple orbs bump. If more than 3 are within reach, choose 3 to affect. When all 3 orbs have bumped into a creature, gain (3+CL) temp hp.

Only the orb part of the spell is a buff, not the temp hp.
