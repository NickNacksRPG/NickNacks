You unleash the beauty of the cosmos upon a creature as a group of stars swirl around them. They are fascinated for one round (will negates). When their fascination ends (including if they pass their save), you can spend an immediate action to make the stars move, provided you can see the target. You can direct the stars at another enemy within 30 ft.

This can repeat indefinitely, but cannot effect the same creature more than once. If you do not spend an immediate action to redirect the spell, it ends.
