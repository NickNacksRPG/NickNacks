For the duration of this spell, you get a mental ping whenever anything happens to the targeted plant or plot of terrain. You are informed what kind of interaction happened, such as whether it was trampled, touched, clipped, watered, etc. no matter how insignificant the interaction. You're also aware of the environmental conditions they are experiencing, such as approximate temperature, humidity, and even noise level.

For animate plants, you gain a +2 bonus to nature checks to determine their health and needs, and can identify such mentally and remotely.

This spell does not grant visual stimuli.
