<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="118"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ring</td><td>You create a Ring of Recoil, which reflects 1 true damage on every instance of damage to the creature that inflicted it, if any. Once it has reflected 20 damage, the ring disintegrates.</td></tr><tr><td>Necklace</td><td>You create a Necklace of Breathing, which automatically activates when you run out of breath, such as underwater or in outer space. As long as your airways are not obstructed, you can continue to breathe. After 20 minutes of cumulative use, the necklace disintegrates. The necklace is always used in 20 minute increments</td></tr><tr><td>Jewel</td><td>You create a Jewel of Preservation, which sends a distress signal to up to 5 total friends and family members of your choice when you are Defeated, Dead, or fear for your life. They receive a brief telepathic message in your voice that describes your location to the best of your knowledge, and to please send help. They cannot respond to this message, and after the message is sent, the jewel disintegrates.</td></tr></tbody></table>
