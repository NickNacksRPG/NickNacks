You mark a position on the ground and a dark shadow forms over it, indicating great danger to those nearby. At the start of your next turn, a chunk of condensed cosmic energy lands on this spot, dealing 4d12+CL (26+CL) force damage (reflex halves).

If a creature's speed is zero (such as from being stunned or entangled) it has disadvantage on its save.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d12 (6).
