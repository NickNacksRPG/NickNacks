You create a cage like structure at the edge of the radius of this spell. Creatures can still see in and out of the cage, and still have line of effect. The cage provides no cover.

If a creature moves in or out of the cage, willingly or unwillingly, it is stunned for 1 round (fort reduces effect to dazed) and its movement is halted. A creature can only be affected by the spell once.
