You alter the composition of the heavens in such a way to mimic the effect of a lunar eclipse. The radius of the spell is coated in darkness. All non-magical light sources are immediately extinguished and cease to function while in the spells area. Magical light sources that existed in the area previously, that are cast in the radius or are brought into its radius after the fact must succeed on a caster level check (DC 11+CL) or they fizzle.

Lunar eclipse ends automatically if solar eclipse is cast in its range, cancelling each other out.

All weather inducing spells do not function underground.
