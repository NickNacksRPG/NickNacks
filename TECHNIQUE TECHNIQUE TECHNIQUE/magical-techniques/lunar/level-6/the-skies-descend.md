You mark a position on the ground and a dark shadow forms over a 20 ft radius, and an bright and shining object hurtling towards it is visible from the sky. At the start of your next turn, a small star lands on this spot, dealing 7d10+CL (33+CL) force damage and stuns for 1 round (reflex halves dmg and turns stun into stagger).

The star then sends a shockwave out to affect all enemies within a 100ft radius. They are automatically treated as though they pass their save.
