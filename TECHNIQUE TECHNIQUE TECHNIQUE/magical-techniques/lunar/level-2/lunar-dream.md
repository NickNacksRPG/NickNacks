{% hint style="info" %}
This spell must be cast in the presence of moonlight.
{% endhint %}

You fall asleep, your body lifted into the air on a cloud of stardust.

Every minute, you regain 1 hp. After 30 minutes, you are restored to full health. You also gain a new save vs poisons and non-curse spell effects.

You are otherwise asleep as normal, and anything that would normally wake you up still can, and ends the spell early, denying its full effect.
