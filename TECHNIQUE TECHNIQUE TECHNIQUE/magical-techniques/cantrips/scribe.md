You touch a book, scroll or other form of writing and give the text a faint glow. The utensil moves on its own to copy down the content you targeted onto the paper, parchment etc. you provided as a focus. It copies down the text at a rate of about 1 page of an average book per minute in your handwriting. If you are trained in the linguistics skill, you can duplicate the handwriting.
