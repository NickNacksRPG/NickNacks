You cause the ground underneath a creature to react unfavorably to their movement. If the targeted creature moves at all on their next turn, they must roll a reflex save or a piece of the ground intercepts their movement. They take d6 (3) bludgeoning damage and they have their speed reduced by 15 ft until they spend a standard action bitching and moaning about it.
