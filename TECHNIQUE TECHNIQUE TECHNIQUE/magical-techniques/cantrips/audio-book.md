You touch a book, scroll or other form of writing and give the text a faint glow. As long as you could read the text normally and you concentrate, the text is automatically read out loud. It is in your voice in a language that you can speak.

After casting the spell, you can leave and go about your business and the spell continues to work its magic. You can dictate a starting point, and the pages flip all on their own, highlighting the text as it is read.
