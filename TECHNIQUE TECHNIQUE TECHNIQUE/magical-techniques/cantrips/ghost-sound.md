You create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound is created when casting it and cannot change the sound.

The sound mimics whatever you want. It can sound like a cafeteria, crowd, waterfall, lion roaring etc, but cannot produce intelligible speech, or sound like a specific person. It can be very loud, but cannot be loud enough to cause harm or otherwise affect anything physically.

When exposed to this sound, a creature can roll a will save to realize it is fake.
