You create a ghostly ethereal hand that can pick up items and perform a simple task such as opening doors, pulling up pants or tipping over buckets. It can carry up to 10 lbs and has a +0 bonus to athletics. The hand cannot do anything that takes longer than one turn to perform unless you add the \[concentration] tag and focus on its actions with yours each turn.

You can use the hand to perform a bully or shove combat maneuver with a bonus of +1.
