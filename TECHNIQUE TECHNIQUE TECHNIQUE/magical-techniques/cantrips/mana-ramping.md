{% hint style="info" %}
The target of this spell must be willing. This means it cannot be used against creatures that have no will of their own, that lack intelligence or enemies that have been defeated.
{% endhint %}

You touch your staff to the target creature and drain the mana from them. They mana burn equal to their maximum mana-1. A mana crystal appears in the creature's possession with mana equal to the amount they mana burned -1. This makes it useless on most commoners.

Mages typically use this to collect from themselves for the convenience of not needing to go through other adventuring guilds, craftsmen or churches to get the mana they need for their own projects.

You can also use this spell to combine all mana crystals in your possession together. The smaller crystals are absorbed by the larger crystal and you add the mana values together.
