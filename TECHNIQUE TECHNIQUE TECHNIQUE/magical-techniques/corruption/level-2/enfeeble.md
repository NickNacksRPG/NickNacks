With heavy arms, the creature struggles to bring the full force of their attacks and spells. Whenever the creature deals damage, that damage is decreased by 2 (unless it is true damage).

While a non-minion creature within 60 ft is afflicted with this curse (and you are its caster), you get advantage on fortitude saves.

In order to remove this curse, a creature must sheathe and unsheathe a sword 3 times without doing anything else. In combat this requires a FRA.
