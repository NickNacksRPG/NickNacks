{% hint style="info" %}
Special: You must speak directly to a creature to inflict this curse, or otherwise have its attention.
{% endhint %}

You inflict an omen upon the creature. At some point within the next 24 hours, they will encounter a dangerous scenario that will deal 20 damage to them (reflex negates). The damage type could be something falling on them for crush damage, getting struck by lightning for zap damage etc.

A creature trained in arcana that is the target of this spell can identify it (DC 17). If successful, it can diffuse the omen by treating you with kindness.

If a creature trained in arcana witnesses the deadly effect of violent accident, they can make an arcana check to identify the origin of the effect. If they happened to be present when it was inflicted, they also are able to identify who cast it.
