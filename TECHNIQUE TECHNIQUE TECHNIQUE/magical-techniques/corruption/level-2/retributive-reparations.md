Curse an object to reject its owner, unless that owner is you. The first time a creature picks up this item it is inflicted with a curse (will negates).&#x20;

The curse causes them to be unable to separate from the item, unless it gives it back to you, and fatigues them until it does. If the creature tries to use the item, like unlocking a door with a cursed key or swinging a cursed weapon, they become drained 1.

The creature doesn't need to hold the item per se, but it does need to be on their person. If they try something clever like putting the key in a backpack, then taking the backpack off, the backpack defies logic and stays put, just like the key would.&#x20;

The creature can return the cursed item to you as a swift action, removing the curse. Alternatively, if you spend 1 week more than 1 mile away from this creature, the curse naturally fades.
