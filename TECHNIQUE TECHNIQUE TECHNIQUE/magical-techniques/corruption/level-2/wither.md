<table><thead><tr><th width="161">Effect</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Range</td><td>60 ft</td></tr><tr><td>Target</td><td>1 creature</td></tr><tr><td>Duration</td><td>3 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>Save</td><td>Fort</td></tr></tbody></table>

Cause a creature to atrophy over 3 rounds. This has no immediate effect, but at the start of the creatures turn it withers (fort negates). The first failure fatigues the creature and reduces their speed by 15. The second and third failure reduce their speed by an additional 15.

This effect continues for three turns, regardless if the creature passes its save (unless it has stalwart).
