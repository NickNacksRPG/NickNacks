The curse of the harvester is a tool used by creatures to remotely collect mana. Because of the cast time, the creature must either be willing or defeated to be the target of this spell. You link a creature to the inert mana crystal used as a focus. You also specify a time of day.&#x20;

Every day at the specified time, the target is mana burned until they only have 1 mana left, as though they had donated mana. The harvester receives (this mana value-1), which they can use as they see fit.

This curse can only be removed by destroying the inert mana crystal used as the focus for the initial casting. The harvestee can innately tell if a crystal is bound to them by looking at it, feeling it etc.
