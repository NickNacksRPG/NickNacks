# Corruption

Demons, fey, undead and all manners of evil mages manufacture malefic methods of harming their enemies and the world around them. The corruption tree focuses on making everybody else miserable. Curses are their favorite method of delivering this suffering.

{% hint style="info" %}
Curses are permanent debilitating status effects that sometimes have a degree of freedom over the types of curses are inflicted. All but the most powerful of curses have some finite, actionable and often unusual way to lift them (which can be found out by using the "identify affliction" function of [medicine](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/medicine)).
