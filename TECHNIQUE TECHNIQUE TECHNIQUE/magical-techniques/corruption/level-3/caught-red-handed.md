Drawing upon the spiritual link between a corpse and its killer, you reach out across space to brand the killer of the corpse you used as a focus for this spell, creating a physical manifestation of the killer’s guilt.

The killer’s right hand is stained a crimson red, and this stain can’t be removed (though it can be hidden by mundane means such as by wearing gloves). If the killer doesn’t have a right hand for some reason, the spell instead causes a red stain in the shape of a hand to appear elsewhere on the creature’s body (typically on the arm).

This spell affects only the creature that directly killed the targeted corpse. Other individuals that contributed to the target’s death are unaffected. If the victim did not die from violence or died indirectly (for instance, if the creature died from suffocating after someone trapped it in a room filling with water), then the spell fizzles. Once a corpse has acted as the focus for red hand of the killer, it can never act as the focus for another casting of red hand of the killer.
