You curse up to 4 creatures with a rot that accelerates their demise when they exist near one another. When a creature with this curse exists within 15 feet of an ally that is also cursed during its turn, it takes 4d6 (14) necrotic damage and is drained 1. This is a \[persistent] effect.

Each cast of this spell is not mutually exclusive. Multiple castings of this spell have the potential to include more creatures in this effect.&#x20;

This curse is removed by the cursed creatures all signing their name on something like paper or parchment without damaging each other in the process, and then burning it.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, affect an additional creature.
