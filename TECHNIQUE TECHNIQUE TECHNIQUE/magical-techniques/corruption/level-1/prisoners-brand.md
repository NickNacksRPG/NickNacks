You touch the creature and apply the brand used as the focus component. It is slightly uncomfortable when applied, but does not cause damage. You are constantly aware of the direction of this creature. You can brand multiple creatures, but you cannot tell which creature is which.

Petting an eagle removes this curse and its associated brand. Other types of freedom-related creatures can potentially suffice.
