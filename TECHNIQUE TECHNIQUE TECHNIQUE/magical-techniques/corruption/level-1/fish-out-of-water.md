Curse a creature so they can no longer breath air, and must inhale water in order to breath.

Unless there is a sizable water source nearby to submerge themselves in, cursed creatures must spend a swift action each turn to breathe, dunking their heads in puddles, or guzzling water. They must have some form of liquid on their person or nearby in order to do this otherwise they begin to suffocate.

While suffocating, the creature is silenced. If they end their turn suffocating, they are drained 1.

This spell has no effect on creatures that are aquatic, amphibious, or that do not need to breathe (such as a skeleton).

In order to end this curse, a creature must drink a glass of iced tea.

If its iffy as to whether or not there's water sufficient enough to stave, roll a luck check for the victims, with a DC dependent on terrain.
