You emanate an aura that absorbs energy from creatures attempting to heal. This aura follows you as you move. Creatures other than you are bone chilled while within this aura, and for 1 round after they leave it.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - By spending 4 mana, you also gain any healing you negate from the bone chill you inflict with this aura.&#x20;
