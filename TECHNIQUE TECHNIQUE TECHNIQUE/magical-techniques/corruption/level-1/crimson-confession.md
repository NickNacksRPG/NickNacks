You touch an object and infuse it with a curse to help you keep track of creatures who mess with it. When you lay this curse you can name creatures that circumvent the curse out loud.

Afterwords, if any creature touches or directly moves the object, including through gloves, telekinesis or a long stick, their skin turns a bright crimson color (will negates). If their skin was already crimson, they turn blue. Once a creature has passed their save against this effect, they are immune to further touches against the same cast.

If you cast this spell on an object while you already have a crimson confession active, the previous one disappears.

The creature must either admit to touching the object to the caster , or they must manually cover their body in paint of their previous skin color to remove the curse.
