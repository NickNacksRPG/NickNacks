You bend the wind to your will, and you will it to destroy. Over the course of the cast time, the weather worsens, giving creatures the opportunity to run and hide. Wind speeds increase to the extent where even heavy objects get picked up and tossed around. All but the most sound structures are damaged and weak structures are outright destroyed within minutes.

You gain a fly speed (60) while within the area of the spell. Other flying creatures are automatically clumsy 4 and all ranged attacks have a -4 penalty to attack.

Creatures without proper protection, that don't take shelter and lack proficiency in the athletics skill are whipped up by the winds and tossed 30 feet in a random direction every turn, taking 2d6+CL (7+CL) crush damage. Creatures that take shelter are generally safe, while those that have protection and/or have athletics can roll checks (spell DC) each turn they move through an open area affected by this spell or they are tossed.

In areas where numerous loose objects are plentiful, you can use a standard action to command the winds to blow them at your enemies. The objects deal 4d6 (14+CL) physical damage (reflex halves), with the AoE being determined by the size of the object (max huge).

You are immune to the effects of the wind and any objects that might get tossed your way.

All weather inducing spells do not function underground.
