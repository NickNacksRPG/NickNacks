You take a breath so deep that you can use it to inhale enormous quantities of air in a 40 ft radius around you. This is best used against clouds of smoke, fog or poison. As long as you concentrate, you can hold this air in your massive cheeks without any harm to yourself. When you cease concentration, you can exhale these gases as a 30 ft cone attack if they were harmful, inflicting whatever negative effect they had using your save DC. Regardless of what you exhale, the gas dissipates immediately after the attack.
