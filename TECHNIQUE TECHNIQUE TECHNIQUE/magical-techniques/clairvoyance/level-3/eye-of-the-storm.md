You surround yourself with a tempest that you can command. You get advantage on saves against \[air] effects +2 ac against ranged attacks and spaces within your natural reach are considered difficult terrain. Harmful gasses, smoke, fog etc is blown directly away from you, clearing areas you move into.

As a standard action while the spell persists, you can spend a standard action to make an attack against a creature within 30 ft with a gust of wind. This attack can be melee if made against a creature within reach. It deals 2d6+CL (7+CL) crush damage and an equal amount of poise damage. If this breaks the creatures poise, you can choose to shove it or knock it down.
