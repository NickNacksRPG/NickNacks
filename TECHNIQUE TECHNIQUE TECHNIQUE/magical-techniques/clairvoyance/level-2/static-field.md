While this spell is active, you crackle with electricity. Your melee attacks deal an additional 2 zap damage and apply a mark to enemies on hit. As a standard action while this persists, you can end the spell with one big stream of electric current. Marked creatures you have line of effect to automatically take 3d8+CL (13+CL) zap damage, even if you can't see them.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage of the standard action blast by d8 (4).
