All ranged attacks passing through the wall take a -4 penalty to attack unless they originate from a siege weapon. Exceptionally small creatures such as insects cannot pass through the wall. The wall can also reasonably protect against things like harmful gases.

Moving through the wall costs 15 ft of movement. Creatures that opt to stand inside of a wind wall are clumsy 2 until they exit.

You can choose to make the wall in 2 shapes.\
