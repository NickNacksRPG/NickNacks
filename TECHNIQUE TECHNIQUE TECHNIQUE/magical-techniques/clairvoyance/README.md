# Clairvoyance

Clairvoyance is leader and mother to all cloud giants. She and her children dominate the mountainous northern region of the world plagued by all manner of windstorms and blizzards. She covets wealth in all of its forms and regularly uses her power and influence to steal from those that think they can live in her cold and desolate corner of the world.

Clairvoyanceâ€™s spells are centered around the manipulation of wind, storms and lightning.
