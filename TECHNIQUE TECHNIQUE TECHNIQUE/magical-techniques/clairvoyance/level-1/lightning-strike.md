Electrify a melee weapon, natural attack or unarmed strike. Concentrate until you land an attack with it. On hit the electricity arcs to another target within 15 ft. All secondary targets take the entirety of the attacks damage as lightning damage (reflex halves). They do not suffer any of its on-hit or additional effects. You choose the targets.

If you are disarmed of the weapon you cast this spell on, you cease concentration and the spell ends.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - Every additional mana spent allows you to increase the number of additional targets.
