As an immediate action, you can choose to direct any effects with the \[zap] tag to yourself, provided you are within range 30 ft the effect's origin or destination.

You can use yourself as a target for any effects that require multiple creatures to chain \[zap] effects and are immune to allied \[zap] effects without reducing the number of creatures it effects.
