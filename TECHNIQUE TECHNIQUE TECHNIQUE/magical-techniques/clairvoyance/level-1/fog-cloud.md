Cause a fog cloud to roll into the area and linger for a bit. Creatures outside of the fog cloud can only see 5 ft into it. Creatures inside of the fog cloud can only see 5 ft in front of them. Even still, such creatures have partial concealment.

Creatures beyond 5 ft of fog have total concealment.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast 4</mark> - The fog becomes much thicker. Creatures treat it as difficult terrain. It can also soften falls.
