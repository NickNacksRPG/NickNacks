# Shira

When you try and figure out who the most attractive lady is at a party, it's often a question of who is second best, for whenever you get a closer look at #1, it's Shira. People submit to the Cataclysm for strength, and Moogen for stealth, but this demon lord prefers subterfuge. She often exists among mortals, playing along with the politics and wars for fun. Being the least abrasive and the most approachable, Shira is the demon lord the most mortals find intertwined in their life, often not knowing that they deal with a demon.

Shira spells focus on deceit as well as mental domination of both overt and subtle varieties.
