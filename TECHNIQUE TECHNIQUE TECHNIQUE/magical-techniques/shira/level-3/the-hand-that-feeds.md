You bring forth all of the negative memories and feelings a companion has for its leader. The target companion is taunted by its leader for 1 round (will negates). It does not use any recharge abilities while taunted in this way. This ability cleanses all other taunt effects currently affecting the companion creature if the spell is successful.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast 5</mark> - You can target 2 companion creatures.
