You flood the creatures senses with stimuli, overloading them (will negates). They have -15 speed, blurred vision and any blindsense they have is disabled. They have weakness 2 to all damage. This weakness can only be applied once per effect (ie multiple damage types on something like a fire sword donâ€™t deal +4 dmg per strike).

An affected creature can make an additional save at the end of each of their turns. If wet, this additional save has advantage.
