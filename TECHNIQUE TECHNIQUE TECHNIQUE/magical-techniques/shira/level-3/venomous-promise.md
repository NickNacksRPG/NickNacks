Your words are poison, but they don't know that. Whenever you share information and get a creature to promise not to tell anybody (or something to that effect), you can infect the creature with a venomous promise.

From that point after, if they share any information related to what they promised about, they succumb to the effects of the spell. They are immediately envenomed. You are aware of when this happens, who triggered it and what they said and can immediately begin scrying, sensing through the creature that broke the agreement.

You can do this for up to 10 minutes. At any point during the scrying, including when it ends, you can deal 40 poison damage to the creature. This damage is nonlethal and does not immediately kill them (though the venom might).
