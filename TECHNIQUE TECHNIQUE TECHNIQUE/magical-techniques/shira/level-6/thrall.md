Worm your way deep into a creature's psyche and take control of their body. Functions as [Domination](../level-4/domination.md), but must be cast on a willing or helpless creature. The domination lasts indefinitely. The creature does not receive new saves and must be freed through other means, magical or otherwise.&#x20;

If a friend, ally, respected superior, family member etc spends a standard action to sway the creature, it gets a will save against the effect with disadvantage. If at least three creatures spend their turn doing this at once, the save is not at disadvantage. Certain types of people, such as people related to the controlled creature's destiny or true love can give a creature advantage on their save.
