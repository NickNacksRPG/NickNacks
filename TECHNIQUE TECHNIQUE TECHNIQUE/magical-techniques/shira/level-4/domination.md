You link your mind with a creature and enforce your will upon it. For the duration of the spell the creature is charmed and you can telepathically give orders to the dominated creature. They must follow these orders unless they are very obviously self-harming (ex. KYS NOW). For all intents and purposes, this creature is considered your ally as long as they are dominated. If you know of the creature's abilities, you can command it to use them, otherwise they use their normal tactics, but to aid you.

At the end of each turn, the creature gets a new save against the effect.

The spell ends if any of your allies harm the target (including you).&#x20;

This spell can only be cast 1/minute.
