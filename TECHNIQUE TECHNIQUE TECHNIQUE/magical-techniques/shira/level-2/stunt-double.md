You instantly apply a disguise to the target creature that causes them to appear identical to you.

While standing adjacent to a creature that looks identical to you, attacks and targeted spells roll to randomly target among everyone (will save per attempt negates, passing this save causes an attacker to be immune to the same cast of the spell).
