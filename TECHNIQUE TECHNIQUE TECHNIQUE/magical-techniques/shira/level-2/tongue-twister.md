You add an extra load to all mental actions related to a creatureâ€™s speaking, causing their speech to be slowed and slurred (will negates). In order to speak at all, the creature must spend a swift action instead of a free action (ex sharing information with monster lore). In order to cast a spell that normally requires a swift action, the creature must spend a standard action. In order to cast a spell that normally requires a standard action, the creature must spend a FRA.

This increase in action cost can reasonably apply to any other actions based on speech as well.
