You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity (will negates). You may select from the following options. The spell specifies whether the creature can take other actions, or if their actions provoke AoOs.

<mark style="color:green;">Approach</mark> - On its turn, the subject moves directly towards you 30 ft, provoking AoOs

<mark style="color:green;">Drop It</mark> - On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can’t pick up any dropped item on the same turn it drops it.

<mark style="color:green;">Kneel</mark> - The subject is knocked down. It may act normally but takes any appropriate penalties.

<mark style="color:green;">Begone</mark> - On its turn, the subject moves 30 ft directly away from you, provoking AoOs.

<mark style="color:green;">Praise Me</mark> - The subject babbles on about your greatness, effectively silencing them for 1 round.

&#x20;If the subject can’t carry out your command on its next turn, it defaults to kneel.
