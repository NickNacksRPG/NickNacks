An illusory duplicate of yourself leaves your square, which moves at up to your speed per round and takes a path of your choosing. It can go around corners if you know where to turn to not hit terrain or creatures. It cannot replicate any actions besides moving and smiling.

Creatures that are threatening you when you cast this spell must make an AoO on the duplicate (will negates).

If the duplicate enters a creature's space or impassable terrain, any creature that witnesses it instantly disbelieves it. A creature that identifies your spell when you cast it instantly disbelieves it.
