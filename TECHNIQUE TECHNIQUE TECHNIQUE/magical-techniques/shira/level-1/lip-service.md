You can make a creature think you said something you didnâ€™t. You can implant simple ideas that require no more than two sentences to convey (I think your hat looks lovely. Where did you get it?) into their head that they think that you said in the middle of a conversation, while masking what you actually said during the few seconds it would take to speak.

In essence you can speak to two different people at the same time and tell them two different things.
