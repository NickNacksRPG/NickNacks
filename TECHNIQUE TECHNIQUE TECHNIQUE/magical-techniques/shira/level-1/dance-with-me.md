You extend your hand to a creature and offer to dance. You immediately move 15 ft in a direction of your choosing and charm the creature during its next turn. It cannot move while entangled in your routine, but it can otherwise act normally (will reduces effect to 15 speed penalty).

{% hint style="info" %}
Unique: If you have the perform (dance) skill, then you can move 30 ft in a direction of your choosing on a failed save.
