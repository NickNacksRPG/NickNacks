You link the minds of all creatures with intelligence higher than -2 that can hear the sound of your voice and see you. For the duration of the cast time, you must speak and stand relatively still. What you talk about during the minute cast time is of little importance, all that matters is that you speak. You automatically catch the attention of every creature if nobody is under duress for the duration of the cast time.

At the end of the cast time, all minion creatures are automatically charmed by you. For non minions (will negates). A creature of your level or higher needs not make a save at all. After the minute, you can move around, ensnaring more people in your speech as long as you continue speaking.

While charmed, creatures will follow you around and agree with basically everything you have to say. You can parade them around, have them protest, have them clap at your performances etc. They will avoid actively engaging in obviously dangerous activities, like jumping off cliffs, attacking people or walking into a war zone.&#x20;

Stopping the spell or playing beautiful music can break this spell's effect. The profession DC to do so is the spell's DC+5.
