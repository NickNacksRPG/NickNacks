You summon an ghostly bloodied hand that you can used to deliver reach spells from a range. Spells with a range of reach gain a range of 30 ft. You can make these attacks as melee attacks or ranged attacks. Defaults to melee.

The hand ambiently floats around you when not in use, but you can choose to pocket it if you don't want creatures to see it.
