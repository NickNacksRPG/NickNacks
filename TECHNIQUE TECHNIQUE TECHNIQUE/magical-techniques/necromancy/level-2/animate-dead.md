<table><thead><tr><th width="161">Effect</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Range</td><td>Reach</td></tr><tr><td>Target</td><td>1 corpse</td></tr></tbody></table>

You lay your hand on a corpse, reanimating it with profane power into a zombie, or tearing the skeleton from its body. The creature is mindless, but it does understand your orders. It will protect you when you are in danger or carry out simple manual labor. Animated dead act on your turn in initiative, meaning they are automatically surprised if you are. If given no orders, they mindlessly follow you.

Defeated undead, construct, ooze, plant and elemental creatures cannot be targeted by animate dead. If a creature has multiple types and includes one of these types, it cannot be targeted by animate dead.

First, choose one of the following\
<mark style="color:green;">Boner</mark> - Weakness (crush 2)\
<mark style="color:green;">Zombo</mark> - Weakness (slash 2)

The spell has complex rules on how this changes the creatures stats.\


<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="171"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Level</td><td>The creatures level is set to 1/3 your level upon creation (minimum 0).</td></tr><tr><td>Ability Scores</td><td>The creature loses its intelligence score. It's str and dex remain the same.  It's remaining stats are set to +0.</td></tr><tr><td>Skills</td><td>The creature loses all of its skills. It shares your perception bonus.</td></tr><tr><td>Feats</td><td>The creature loses all of its feats.</td></tr><tr><td>Defensive traits</td><td>The creature loses all of its defensive traits other than resistance, immunity and DR. It gains resistance to necrotic damage and +4 bonus to saves against effects to control it. The first time it is defeated, it is instead reduced to 1 hp unless it is defeated by holy damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Attacks</td><td>The creature maintains all of its natural attacks, including any multi-attack options. It can wield weapons if it wielded them in life.</td></tr><tr><td>Offense traits</td><td>Lose all offense traits unless it is marked with the [special attack] tag.</td></tr><tr><td>Other traits</td><td>Keep swim/climb/land speeds. Gain night vision. Lose everything else.</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Special: The spell is going to be cast on a wide variety of creatures, some of which don't exactly fit the mold. Certain features you may want to get rid of and keep something from the creature. Some features might be too powerful on certain creatures and should be removed. DM discretion.

Ex. The creature is blind and senses only using tremorsense. Keep the tremorsense, don't give night vision.



Special: If you die, your undead act instinctively, usually attacking whatever is close at hand at random (including your allies).
