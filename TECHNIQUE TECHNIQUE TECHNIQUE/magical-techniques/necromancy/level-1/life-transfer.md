You transfer fundamental life energy between yourself and the target. Choose one.

<mark style="color:red;">Heal</mark>\
You can inflict drained upon yourself in order to heal the target. You become drained 1 and you heal 10 hp, or remove 1 drain stack from the target.

<mark style="color:red;">Harm</mark>\
Alternatively, you can \[mana burn] to inflict drained stacks you possess onto another creature. This requires an attack roll and removes 1 drained stack from yourself to inflict it on your target on hit. If you miss, you do not mana burn. You must be drained to use this variant of the spell.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - When you heal, you can increase the number of drained stacks you accumulate by 1 for each additional mana spent. For each stack of additional drain you accumulate, you can remove an additional stack of drain from the target or heal an additional 7 hp.

When you harm, each additional mana spent allows you to increase the stacks of drain you pass on to your enemy by 1. You must possess drained stacks equal to the amount you are inflicting.
