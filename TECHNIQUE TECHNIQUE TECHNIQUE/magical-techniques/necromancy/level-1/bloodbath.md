As part of casting the spell, you cut yourself with a held object taking d6 (3) bleed damage immediately and every turn after at the start of your turn. Creatures you target bleed for the same damage you took (fort negates). As long as you continue to bleed, the targets also continue to bleed for the same damage you take each turn.

You can choose to stop bleeding as an instant action, ending the spell.
