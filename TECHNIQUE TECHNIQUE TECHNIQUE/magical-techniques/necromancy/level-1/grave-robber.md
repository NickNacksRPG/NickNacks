While this technique is prepared, you gain an innate sense for when corpses are nearby. You can sense them buried up to 30 feet underground. You can read the text written on tombstones and similar things, even if the text has long since faded. If you can see a corpse, you know what its name was in life.

As a standard action, you can reach into the ground and pull out an entire corpse if it is not inside of a container of some sort.

Undead creatures have a visible aura around them unless they are your level or higher.
