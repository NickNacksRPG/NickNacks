Speak directly to a creature's skeleton, setting it free from the tyranny of its fleshy host.

The spell cannot target creatures that are BONELESS. A successful monster lore check against a creature reveals if it has bones. This spell functions as animate dead, but with a few bonusesâ€¦

* You can target creatures that aren't dead (including undead, but not undead that are only bones)
* Its level is set to the level of the creature the spell is cast on
* Its max HP is the current HP of the creature at time of casting
* It has the perform (dance, trumpet) skill (bonus=CL+4)
