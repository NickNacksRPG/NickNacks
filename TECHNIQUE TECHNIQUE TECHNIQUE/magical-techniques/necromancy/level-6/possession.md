You turn incorporeal and siphon into a creatures mouth to take control of their body (will reduces effect to stagger for 1 round). On each of your subsequent turns, you can play as that creature using all of its abilities and statistics except hp. In order to use activated the abilities, you must have seen the creature use them, or succeed on a local check (DC 15+lvl of creature). If you do not, then you must spend 1 week to accommodate yourself to the new body. Creatures under your control like summons or undead still recognize you as their master.

When you are defeated, dispelled etc, you appear in a space adjacent to the possessed creature and are staggered for 1 round and the creature is drained 3.

If cast on a defeated creature, there is no save. Because the spell uses your vitality to sustain the creature, you can immediately stand up and start fighting.

You get a plus +5 bonus to disguise checks to pretend to be this creature. You can swap between your voice and the creatures voice at will.

The spell cannot be cast again until you rest. When you rest while possessing a creature, you regain your hp, but no other benefits from resting.
