When you are defeated or killed, you can choose to spend 6 mana to enter a ghost state. While in this state, you can freely speak, use supernatural abilities and cast spells, but your speed is 0 and you cannot make weapon, natural or unarmed attacks.

At the end of your next turn, your spirit reunites with your body and this effect ends.

Your ghost remains tethered to your body. You cannot move on your own without the aid of magic, but other creatures can physically move your body to adjust the position of your ghost.
