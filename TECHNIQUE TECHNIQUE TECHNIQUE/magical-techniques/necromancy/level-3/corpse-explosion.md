The effect and cast time of this varies depending on what you target.

<mark style="color:orange;">Allied Undead (Immediate)</mark> - You can cast this freely on any undead you control, even in response to one being destroyed. The creature bloats and cracks before bursting, dealing 3d8+CL (13+CL) necrotic damage (reflex halves). This kills the undead.

<mark style="color:orange;">A Corpse (Standard)</mark> - You can cast this spell on a corpse. Its range increases to 60 ft, its AoE increases to 10 ft but its cast time increases to a standard action.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - By spending 5 mana, you can cause the the initial explosion to deal 5d8+CL (22+CL) necrotic damage. In addition, you set off a chain reaction, causing all corpses in the spell's area to also explode, and the corpses they effect and so on. A creature can still only be damaged by a single explosion.
