{% hint style="info" %}
Because this is a concentration spell, it requires you hold your staff. Because it also detaches a hand, it requires you also have a free hand.
{% endhint %}

One of your hands detaches and flies over to a creature to choke it and lift it into the air (fort negates). They take 2d6+CL (7+CL) crush damage. The creature is silenced, entangled, cannot ingest consumables and takes the same damage again at the end of each of its turns as long as you stay within 30 ft of them. If the target passes its save, you move more than 30 ft away from the target, or the spells duration expires your hand flies back and reattaches automatically.

Your hand can be targeted using all of your statistics, but it has cover (+2 AC/reflex).
