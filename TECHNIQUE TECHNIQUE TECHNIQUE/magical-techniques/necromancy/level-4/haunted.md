Take a creature or an object for a ride. Detach your spirit from your body, causing it to look like you are napping or have your head in the clouds. Attach your freed spirit to a creature or object within range (will negates against creatures). If the object is possessed by a creature (ha), then you are effectively targeting the creature and it still gets a save.

If you are successful, you can swap between using your own senses and the senses of what you are attached to. The creature remains unaware of your presence unless you make it known. You can telekinetically move objects within 30 ft around while haunting. Objects weighing less than 5 pounds can be tossed and objects under 100 lbs can be slowly dragged. You can also telepathically speak to the creature, making your voice sound vague and ghost-like or your own voice.

A creature with arcana or religion recognizes the moving objects or voices as a possession with a DC 14 check. By uttering a prayer or drinking holy water, the spell immediately ends. You can also choose to end it willingly at any time.
