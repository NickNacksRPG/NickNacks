This spell spell functions as animate dead, but changes as follows.&#x20;

It raises the creature as a zombie version of itself. Upon completion, your spirit leaves your body and inhabits the zombified corpse. You can inhabit this corpse indefinitely, and speak through it in the creatures voice, your own, or a raspy mixture of the two.

You can choose to no longer inhabit the corpse at any time, returning back to your body and causing the magic animating it to leave. This kills the zombie.

While you animate this corpse, any other undead you have animated enter a coma, and reanimate once you return.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast 5</mark> - You can choose to animate the corpses of 3 similar creatures at once, such as members of a town guard.
