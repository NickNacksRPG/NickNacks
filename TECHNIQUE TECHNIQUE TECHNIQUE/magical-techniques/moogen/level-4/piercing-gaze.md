Close one of your eyes and cause a much larger illusory copy of it to open on the ground. It swells before bursting in a cloud of sharp fragments, dealing 5d6+CL (17+CL) pierce damage and applying a curse (reflex halves dmg and negates curse).

While a creature is cursed with your piercing gaze, a tattoo of your eye appears on their back. You see their aura as a glowing outline around their person, even through total cover. You get a +8 bonus to perception and survival checks to track them.

At any point in the future, you can close it again (standard action) in the future to open an obvious illusory copy of your eye above a creature cursed with your piercing gaze. You can watch them through this eye indefinitely. If they attempt to move or cover the eye, it evades barriers attacks etc in order to keep line of sight on the cursed creature.

This curse is removed by spending an hour to write your own eulogy, then burying it that night.
