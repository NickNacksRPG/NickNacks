When you cast this spell, you fall into a catatonic state until your target falls asleep. You can choose to leave this state if you feel they are taking too long. When it falls asleep, it's dreams are plagued by horrific imagery of your choosing. When the creature wakes up from this dream, it is drained 1 (will negates). This spell has no mechanical effect against a creature that is already drained, but you can still haunt their dreams if you want.

If you know the creature well enough to know about some deep-seated fear that they have, the creature has disadvantage on their saving throw.
