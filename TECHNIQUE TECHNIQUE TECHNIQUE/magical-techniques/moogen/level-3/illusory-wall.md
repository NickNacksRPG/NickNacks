You create a wall, floor or ceiling of any type that can appear to be made of anything. It blends seamlessly with the nearby terrain to appear as natural as possible. The wall can be no larger than 10x10 feet. You cannot chain cast invisible walls to make a bigger wall.&#x20;

If the wall would take any damage then it immediately disappears. If a creature attempts to move through the wall or otherwise interact with it meaningfully, then it disappears.
