You pluck one of your eyes from your head and seal the empty eyelid. After, you place the plucked eye onto a surface. It melds into that surface and closes. By placing your hand over your other eye(s), you can open the plucked eye and gaze/hear through it instead of where your body is.

By forcefully opening the sealed eye, you end this spell. If a creature pokes the eye, whether its open or closed, the spell ends. Otherwise, it lasts indefinitely. They eye appears as Moogen's eye instead of yours.

Whenever the eye is open, creatures present can roll perception to notice it each day. The DC is either your spell DC, or 15+(your stealth bonus).
