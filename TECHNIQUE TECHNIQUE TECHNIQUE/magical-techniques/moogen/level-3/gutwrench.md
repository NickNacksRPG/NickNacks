Inflict a creature with a staggering pain in their stomach. When they look down, they see a blade inflicting a horrible wound upon them, either emerging from their stomach, or grazing their waist. What they see is what they believe, and what they believe manifests into reality. The creature takes 4d8+CL (18+CL) pierce damage and causes them to bleed d6 damage for 2 rounds (will halves damage and negates bleed).

While a creature is bleeding from this spell, they are also effectively silenced as they cough up blood.
