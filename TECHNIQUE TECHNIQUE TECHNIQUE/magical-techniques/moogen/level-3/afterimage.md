Functions as invisibility (Moogen 6) but only lasts until the end of turn. In addition, you leave behind an illusory copy of yourself in your current position that repeats a simple type of movement you perform right before vanishing. This can be something like shadowboxing or crouching while looking around. This figment lasts for 1 round before disappearing.

If a creature sees you use this technique, they know something is up. If they donâ€™t see you use it, they treat it as the real you (will negates). A creature can identify your afterimages if they have seen one on another occasion.
