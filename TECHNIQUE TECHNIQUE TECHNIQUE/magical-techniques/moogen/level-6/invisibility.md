You appear to vanish from thin air. You gain total concealment, automatically take the hide action and get a +4 bonus on stealth checks while invisible. Objects that you carry turn invisible. This spell ends when you attack or otherwise take some form of aggressive action, like casting a spell or using an item on a creature.

Certain environmental conditions can aid in seeing where this creature is. The presence of water or snow can give a better idea of their position. Inflicting a bleed effect can give you a trail of where they have been. Air that is dense from some kind of particle like dust, or actively throwing something like a bag of flour at the creature can also give you an idea of the creature's position.

Regardless of whether or not you know what space the creature is, they still maintain their total concealment.
