Your shadow detaches and forms a copy of you in your current space. It looks like you, but made of a shadowy mist with your eyes. It is stationary and mimics your attacks/gestures. You can use this shadow as the origin point for your spells and attacks. It can also make AoOs.

You still must be able to see the target of your attacks/spells.

As a swift action, you can teleport to this shadow if it is within 30 ft of you, ending the spell.
