You create an illusory object or creature that to all senses appears real. The size of what you create is limited to a 5x5x5 ft cube, but other than that, there are few limitations. You can create a fire, and it (seems to) gives off heat. You can create a dog and it bounces around in its space and barks. You can create a door that creaks as it swings on its broken hinges.

When you initially cast the spell, you decide a type of behavior that your imaginary creation exhibits. Maybe you want your person that you made to dance, but then the party you're at the music stops. You can spend a standard action concentrating on the spell (as long as you have line of sight to your imagination) to have it change behaviors to instead bow before a king. You cannot change what you imagine, but you can change what your imagination does.

Your imagination isn't limited to the laws of physics, so you can have it do incredibly unusual things, like having a person swim through air or a rock doing flips. However, when creatures see unusual stimuli like that, they get a save to disbelieve it. If someone points out itâ€™s a fake, other creatures automatically see through it and it appears translucent to them.

When used in combat, creatures may waste their time attacking the imaginary creature, but instead of rolling attacks or the imagination rolling saves, the attacking creature rolls a save. Failed saves indicate they miss or the creature resists the attack. Passed saves indicate they see through the ruse, and they can communicate this to their allies, making them automatically disbelieve it, causing the illusion appear translucent to all.

The "concentration" part of the duration allows you to indefinitely maintain this imagination as long as you concentrate each turn as a standard action. You must have line of sight to the imagination to concentrate on it. If you do not concentrate on the spell for 1 minute, it disappears.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - Each additional mana you spend increases the dimensions by 5 ft on all sides, to a max of 4 mana and 20x20x20 dimensions. By spending 5 mana, the duration also changes to permanent, no longer requiring concentration. Dispel magic automatically succeeds against permanent imaginations.&#x20;
