You alter a target's perception, causing it to perceive the world around it as though it were made entirely out of flesh, blood and viscera (will negates). It is shaken 2.  If it interacts with the environment, such as opening a door or climbing a tree, the shaken penalty increases by 1.

To remove the curse you must hug a child.
