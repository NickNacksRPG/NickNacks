You cause the target creature to be alone. All of the creatures allies and neutral parties disappear to all the senses for the target. They are unable to interact with allies directly or target them with specific effects. They can't use anything that requires teamwork like flanking, casting buffs, teamwork feats etc. They might be able to infer the position of their allies based off of how their enemies are acting.

When a creature that possesses companions is targeted by this spell, they are unable to effectively coordinate with them. Their companions temporarily lose the teamwork feats and their commander's charisma bonus to attack while this spell persists. This also applies to individual companions targeted by this spell.
