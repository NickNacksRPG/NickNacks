By holding your hands in the air and making some silly hand gestures, you can create sinister shadows along the ground and walls. As long as you concentrate, you can continue to make these innocuous shadow puppets for entertainment and such.&#x20;

Any creature proficient in arcana immediately gets a check to identify the spell (DC 17) if they can see the puppet show.

At any point (including immediately when you cast the spell) you can cause the shadows to come to life and take a bite or otherwise attack a creature. Even if you play with the shadows a bit and delay the attack, it still requires a standard action. The creature takes 3d8+CL (13+CL) slash or pierce damage and is frightened for one round (will halves damage and negates frightened).

If a creature successfully identifies the spell during a show and either they are the target or they warn the creature that is, they get advantage on their saving throw. If the creature is unaware of the danger the shadow puppets hold and they are the target of the spell later, they have disadvantage on their saving throw. Both of these situations can only happen if the caster chooses to delay the negative effects of the spell.

Tl;dr - You can cast the spell as a standard to play with shadows or attack. If you decided to play with the shadows for a bit, you must still spend a standard action to use the attack. Playing with the shadows can just be for flavor, or it can be a risky method to enhance its power against those not trained in arcana.
