You transform a held weapon such that it appears to be made out of complete darkness, absorbing the light around it. You can also choose to transform your staff into another weapon to dual wield, making you unable to cast further spells. You can transform it back as a free action.

If the weapon leaves your hands for longer than 3 rounds, it reverts back to its original state.

Shadow weapons deal frost damage instead of their standard damage type. When you feint a creature while wielding them, it takes (CL) frost damage.
