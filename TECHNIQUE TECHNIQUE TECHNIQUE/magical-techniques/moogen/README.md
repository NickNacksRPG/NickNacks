# 👁️ Moogen

Moogen isn’t so much a creature as she is an idea. She is handily replaced by anyone who can outwit her, kill her, then take her place. She is a demon that exists in the shadows, content to play with the affairs of others (usually mortals). She regularly invites mortals into her loving arms as pawns in some kind of scheme, always ready with a knife to their back if they don’t play along.

Moogen spells assist in manipulating light sources, stealth and misdirection.
