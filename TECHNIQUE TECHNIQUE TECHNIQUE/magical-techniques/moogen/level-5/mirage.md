You affect a wide area to completely change its appearance into something else. You can create an oasis in a desert, a house on a hill or make your house look like a flat piece of land. Creatures typically don't get a save to disbelieve the illusion unless something tips them off: bumping into a wall that shouldn't be there or drinking from a pool of water that holds only sand. The less suspicious and out of place the mirage is, the less likely creatures get a will save to see through it.

Casting mirage a second time removes the previous one.
