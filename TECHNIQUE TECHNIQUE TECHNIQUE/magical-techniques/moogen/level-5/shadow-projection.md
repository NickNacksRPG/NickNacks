You create an illusory duplicate that is shaped like you but it's almost entirely black, save for its eyes. You project this shadow to a location within the spells range that you can see. While occupying this shadow, you can speak and move around freely in this new illusory body. You can cast spells, but you cannot physically interact with objects otherwise.

If the shadow is ever exposed to bright light, then it disappears. If it ever takes damage, then you also take the damage and it disappears. It uses all of your statistics to determine its defenses.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast 6</mark> - You no longer need to be able to see the position you initially project your shadow to, though you have to at least seen the place before. The spells range changes to unlimited.
