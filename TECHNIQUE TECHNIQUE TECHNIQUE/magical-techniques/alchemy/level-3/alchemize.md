You instantly turn a hunk of metal into gold. The object can be no larger than a 3x3x3ft cube, and it must be something you are able to hold (in its entirety) in one hand. As long as the item you hold is mostly made out of metal, you convert it to gold equal to 60% of its total value.

This spell can also be used to convert gold into base metals.

I'm currently thinking about the implications this spell has on world building. It's a complex web that makes you consider the value of metal, how the crafting system works and how the world replenishes resources consumed by magic.
