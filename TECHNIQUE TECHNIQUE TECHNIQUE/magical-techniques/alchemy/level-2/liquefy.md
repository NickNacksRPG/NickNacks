Transform target creature into a puddle of water. This prevents them from interacting with objects, unless they are buoyant enough to move as a puddle. As a liquid, they can slip into places they otherwise might not be able to.&#x20;

The spell ends if the liquefied creature takes fire damage, or if they form back into their previous shape as a standard action.
