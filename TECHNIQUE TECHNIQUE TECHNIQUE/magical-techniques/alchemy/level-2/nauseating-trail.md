Immediately dash and disengage, leaving behind a toxic trail in your wake. For the rest of your turn, spaces you move through are filled with a toxic gas that lingers. The gas spreads slightly up into the air, causing the spaces 5 feet above you to also be affected.&#x20;

Any creature that moves through one of these spaces experiences its stench and caustic properties. They take 3d8+CL (13+CL) poison damage and are sickened 1 (fort halves damage and negates sicken).
