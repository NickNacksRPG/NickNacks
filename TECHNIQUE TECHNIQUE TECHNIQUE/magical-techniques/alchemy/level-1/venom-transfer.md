You jab your staff into a creature that is currently envenomed and borrow some of the venom for yourself. Using the venom as a catalyst, you can charge your next attack with an additional d8 (4) poison damage.

The envenomed creature you absorbed the venom from can immediately make a save to end the poison. If they fail, it does not advance the poison further.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also use this technique against a defeated creature that is venomous. They get no benefit or drawback from it.
