You are temporarily much better at conducting heat in a controlled manner. In general you can exist in hot environments comfortably. One of your limbs glows like heated metal and can be used to touch solid objects that are sources of large heat. Up to a 1 ft cube can be affected at a time. By maintaining contact with an object (one FRA) you can store its heat. Later you can choose to diffuse this heat into the air around you, or transfer it to another object. The effects of which depend on the object. Many things simply burn, but others like stone and metals can be softened.

If used as a melee attack, it deals 2d6+CL (7+CL) fire damage.

If you desire, you can immediately diffuse the heat as you touch the hot object continuously. You can affect a 1ft cube per round of contact. Prolonged exposure to heat bothers you less during this spell, but in enclosed spaces, your allies, and eventually even you, can be overwhelmed by heat.
