The end of your staff manifests into a sling or catapult like device. You can load it with any handheld item weighing up to 10 lbs and launch it at a creature. The creature takes d8+CL (4+CL) damage and is also affected by the item catapulted (reflex halves and negates effect of item). The type of damage varies depending on the object thrown.

The creature must also make any appropriate save against catapulted items. Even if a creature passes its save, the item is assumed to land in the creatures space, so if the item activates on impact, the creature may still have to deal with an explosion, grease or whatever other fun stuff gets tossed.
