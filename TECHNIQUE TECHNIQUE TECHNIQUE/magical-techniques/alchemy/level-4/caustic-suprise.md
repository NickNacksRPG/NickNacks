While this contingency is active, your skin seems to bubble and pop, with the frequency and intensity increasing as your hp depletes.

When you die or are defeated, this contingency triggers and you briefly live on, ignoring these conditions. You are unable to take any actions, including dashing, other than movement while in this state, and you ignore all movement impairing effects. At the end of your next turn, your skin explodes in a caustic brine, dealing 5d8+CL (21+CL) poison damage to all creatures (reflex halves)
