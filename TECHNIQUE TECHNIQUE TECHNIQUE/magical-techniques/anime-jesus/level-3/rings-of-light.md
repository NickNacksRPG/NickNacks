You throw many light rings that deal 4d8+CL (18+CL) holy damage (reflex halves).

The rings persist at the end of the cone, forming a line that automatically deals their damage to creatures that move through their spaces. At the end of your next turn, the rings return very quickly directly back to you in a straight line, dealing half the damage again automatically (no save).

If any of the rings impact solid terrain (such as a wall) on either the way out or the way back, they halt in place. Any that donâ€™t continue on their usual path.

The discs give off light in a 20 ft radius.
