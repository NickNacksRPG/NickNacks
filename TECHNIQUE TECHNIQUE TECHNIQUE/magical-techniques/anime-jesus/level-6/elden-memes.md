You create a condensed ball of divine energy and release it into the world. Every round on your turn, the ball of light gently floats towards a target you designate at the time of casting at a speed of 30 feet. If the ball gets within 30 feet of the original target, it starts to gently circle around them clockwise instead of moving towards them. All enemies within 30 feet of the ball at the end of its movement each turn automatically take (CL) holy damage from projectiles that rapidly fire in all directions around it.

If the original target is ever defeated, then a new target can be selected as an instant action.

On the 5th round, the ball advances rapidly towards the original target and explodes in their space.  If the original target is dead, unconscious or has managed to get more than 300 feet away, it instead explodes immediately. The explosion deals 7d8+CL (31+CL) holy damage (reflex halves) in a 20 ft radius to all enemies.
