You throw a disc of light that boomerangs back to you at the start of your next turn. Make a ranged attack and compare the result to every creature within a 30 foot line. Each creature takes (6+CL) holy damage.

The disc persists at the end of its range, automatically dealing its damage to creatures that move through that space. At the start of your next turn, the disc returns very quickly in a line directly back to you dealing half the damage again automatically, requiring no roll.

If you spend an immediate action, you can catch the disc, allowing you to throw it again at no cost. If you do not throw it again on your next turn, it disappears.

If the disc impacts solid terrain (such as a wall) on either the way out or the way back, it halts in place.

The discs give off light in a 20 ft radius.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by 4.
