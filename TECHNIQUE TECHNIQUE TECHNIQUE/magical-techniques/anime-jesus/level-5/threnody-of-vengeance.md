{% hint style="info" %}
Maintaining concentration on this spell consumes your swift actions.
{% endhint %}

You cast this spell in response to an ally being dominated, frightened, defeated, or slain. The ally is stunned for as long as this spell persists, but a golden flaming duplicate of themselves emerges from their space, able to act in their stead. The ally controls the copy, and still consumes its resources if the clone uses any.

The copy has half of their maximum hit points, has no negative conditions copied over, and is taunted by whatever charmed, feared, defeated, or slew them.

If the stunned condition is removed, the ally is no longer dominated/frightened/defeated/slain, the copy is slain, or the ally wills it to end at any point, the spell ends.
