The flames of hell are unleashed through a portal you open up. A line of hellfire that continues until it hits a solid object deals 3d8+CL (13+CL) fire damage to creatures within. The portal remains open for 3 rounds, continuing to damage creatures that move through it.

Fire created by this spell ignores fire resistance.

This spell has great potential for destruction considering its immense AoE and the fact it persists for several rounds, potentially burning holes through creatures and structures alike.
