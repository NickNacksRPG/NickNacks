You throw an enormous ball of fire that attaches to something, then explodes forcefully, dealing 4d8+CL (18+CL) fire damage and knocking down creatures struck (reflex halves dmg and negates knock down).

You can target one specific creature with an attack roll. If you land it, the creature's space is the center of the explosion, and it takes a -2 penalty to its save. If you miss, the fire falls directly down and then explodes when it first impacts a surface.

This also destroys flammable undergrowth, sends small objects flying, starts fires, disperses atmospheric conditions, and otherwise causes the effects one would expect from a fiery explosion.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - Every additional mana spent adds d8 damage, 10 range, and 5 radius.
