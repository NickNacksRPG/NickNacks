You fire a beam of purifying light, dealing 7d8+CL (31+CL) fire damage and blinding everything it hits for one round (reflex halves dmg and negates blind). This automatically destroys objects of solid or lesser toughness, and if it's enough to break them, it continues past them. This damage area is persistent, and creatures that enter it must save against the damage.

Fiends and undead creatures that fail their saves are set ablaze.

You may not move while concentrating on this spell.

At the start of your next two turns, the damage occurs again, and you may sweep the beam up to 45 degrees to target a new line and everything between the two lines that gets caught in the sweep. The sweep area is not persistent, but the new line is.

Turn 1: line\
Turn 2: sweep, new line\
Turn 3: sweep, new line\
Turn 4: spell ends at the start of your turn
