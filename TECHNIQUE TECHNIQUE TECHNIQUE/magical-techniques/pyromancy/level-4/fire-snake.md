Cause a flaming serpent to erupt from your staff. It moves along the ground 30 feet, capable of bending around obstacles and terrain. It continues to occupy that 30 feet of space, burning any that it passes through, or that pass through it. Creatures engulfed by the fiery serpent take 5d8+CL (23+CL) fire damage (reflex negates).

As a swift action on subsequent turns, you can move the snake another 30 feet.
