Your mana reserves ignite and you release this uncontainable energy at an enemy. They take 2d10+CL (11+CL) fire damage (reflex halves). You also temporarily stop memorizing a spell of your choosing until you rest. If that spell was currently active as a buff or concentration effect, it immediately ends.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d10.
