You create a stationary bonfire whose flames move in slow motion, and illuminate an area of 100ft. It can be put out like any other fire.

By resting next to the fire and gazing into its flames for at least 10 minutes, your deity shows you visions of a prominent creature that it wants you to defeat or apprehend. This creature is always a similar level to you, and is a leader of some sort at the forefront of operations in opposition to your deity: a necromancer, bandit chief, cult leader etc. This creature is also somewhat close by in terms of proximity, only targeting creatures you can realistically find within a week of travel using your current means of transportation.
