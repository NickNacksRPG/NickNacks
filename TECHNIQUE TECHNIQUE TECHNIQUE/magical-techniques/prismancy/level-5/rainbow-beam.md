Line attack deals 6d8+CL (27+CL) fire damage to enemies, but instead of harming allies, it grants them a Lucky Rainbow - visible as an aura around them. They may consume this rainbow to reroll any one attack, save, or skill check within a minute, after which it disappears.

A creature may only have one Lucky Rainbow on them at a time. It lasts one minute.

Also creates bright light in its area for a round.
