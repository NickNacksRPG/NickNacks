You become a being of pure light, allowing you to move through glass and obstacles that do not block light (such as wire fences) freely.

You shed light in a 20-foot area. This form can be suppressed while in areas of magical darkness, but you automatically attempt to dispel any such area at the start of your turns.

Sighted creatures that attack you are considered to have blurred vision against you, and creatures that successfully attack you in melee or are grappling with you are set ablaze (reflex negates). No matter how many attacks a creature makes, they cannot be forced to make multiple saves a turn.
