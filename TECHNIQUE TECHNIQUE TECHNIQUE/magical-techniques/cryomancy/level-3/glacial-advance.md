Rapidly advance forward in a straight line riding along a tiny glacier, dealing 4d8+CL (18+CL) frost damage and an equal amount of poise damage (reflex halves). If a creature drops to 0 poise from this, they are shoved 15 ft away from the line in a direction of your choosing.

The area of the spell becomes icy, causing creatures that move through it to fall prone unless they treat it as difficult terrain or roll acrobatics (vs class DC).&#x20;
