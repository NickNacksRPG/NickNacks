You jam your staff into the ground and thin streams of ice advance towards your foes. Choose three creatures within 15 ft of each other. A series of pointed ice spears erupt from the ground directly beneath them, dealing 4d8+CL (18+CL) frost damage, as well as entangling them (reflex halves damage and negates entangle). Athletics as a swift action to escape.

Pass or fail, the spaces occupied by the spears are considered impassible terrain until they are destroyed or melted. A successful reflex save also means the creature can choose any space within 5 ft of the spell effect to move to \[elusive]. Larger creatures create more impassible terrain and dodge farther.

If there are multiple creatures in the same space, you can target the larger creature and hit all creatures in the space, but you cannot target both the creatures to double up on damage.
