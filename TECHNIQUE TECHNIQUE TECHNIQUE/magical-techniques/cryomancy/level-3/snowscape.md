A bunch of clouds roll in and start to deposit large amounts of snow. Temperatures decrease and the area of the spell becomes difficult terrain after 1 minute. Certain gear can allow you to traverse snow unimpeded. Creatures cannot see beyond 100 ft.

If you cast this spell in an area where snow normally is impossible, incredibly unlikely or out of season, the spells duration decreases to 1 minute.

All weather inducing spells do not function underground.
