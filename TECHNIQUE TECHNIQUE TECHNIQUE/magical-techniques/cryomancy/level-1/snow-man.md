You sculpt snow into a more friendly shape, and your new friend does his best to aid you. A snow man is an elemental that shares all of your ability scores, poise, AC and saves. He has half of your max hp. He shares your level, but is always treated as a minion.

He cannot wield weapons, and his only form of attack is a single snowball every turn that deals d8+dex/str crush dmg. If there is no snow present, he must take 3 true damage to throw this snowball. He has a 30 land speed. When not moving along snowy or icey surfaces, his speed is 15.

When the snow man is destroyed, or when the spell ends, the mana burn is removed.
