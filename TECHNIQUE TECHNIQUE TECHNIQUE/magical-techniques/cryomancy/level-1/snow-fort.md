You cause a snowy barrier to appear to protect a creature. The barrier appears all around the creature, protecting them from all sides, but not from attacks from above. They gain cover as long as they do not move from their space. If you stop concentrating or if the fort is hit with fire damage, it crumbles.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast 2</mark> - You can target large creatures, or 2 medium or smaller creatures. The barrier improves to shield from airborne attacks.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast 3</mark> - You can target huge creatures, 2 large creatures, or 3 medium or smaller creatures. The barrier now grants improved cover.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast 4</mark> - You can target up to 4 creatures of any size.
