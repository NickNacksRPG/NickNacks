Rapidly chill a metallic object. If it is not currently attended, it automatically happens. Creatures that touch this item for whatever reason are entangled by rapidly spreading frost.

If the object is attended, then the creature can choose to drop the object as an instant action to negate the effects of the spell and it functions as written above. If they do not drop the object or cannot, such as with metal armor, the creature takes (CL) cold damage at the start of each of their turns and the item cannot be separated from them until heat is applied or you cease concentration.

You can also use this spell to target a creature that is made of metal, functioning as though they cannot drop the object.

Sometimes creatures have features that rely on heated metal. Such features are disabled while they are affected by this spell.
