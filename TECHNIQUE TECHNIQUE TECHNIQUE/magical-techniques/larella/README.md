# Larella

Colene Larella is an elven spell caster whose spells use psychic powers to gather information and out maneuver foes before the battles even begin. If it does come down to a fight, you can crush foes' minds or toss them around with telekinesis. Long distance communication is easy with spells like dream and sending. Creatures won't be able to keep secrets from you with access to spells like detect thoughts and memory movie.
