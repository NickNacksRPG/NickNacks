You exert your psychic power to such an extent that you are able to manipulate heavy objects and toss creatures around against their will. Your eyes glow and you emit a constant repulsive force pushing away loose objects nearby.

For the duration of the spell, you gain a hover speed equal to your land speed. You can use this speed to fly during your turn.

Immediately upon casting the spell, and every turn after as a standard action, you can perform one of the following actions.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="125"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Toss</td><td>Briefly take hold of a creature's body (will negates) and throw them across the battlefield. You move them 30 ft and they take 5d8+CL (22+CL) crush damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Crumple</td><td>Briefly take hold of a creature's body (will negates) and slam them against the ground. They are knocked down and take 5d8+CL (22+CL) crush damage</td></tr><tr><td>Artillery</td><td>Lift large objects or numerous small objects by breaking stone off of walls, shattering branches into needles etc.<br>Toss these objects at your foes. Creatures within range in a 10 ft radius take 5d8+CL (22+CL) physical damage (reflex halves) based on the objects that you threw.</td></tr><tr><td>Maneuver</td><td>Functions as telekinetic maneuver, but with a bonus of (6+CL).</td></tr><tr><td>Repulsion [force]</td><td>Unleash all of the spell's energy at once for one final blast. All creatures within 10 ft of you take 7d8+CL (31+CL) force damage and are pushed 60 feet away from you (fort halves damage and push distance). Repulsion immediately ends telekinesis.</td></tr></tbody></table>
