You enter a trance like state as you try to intercept the thoughts of a specific named sleeping creature.  You can remain in this trance as long as you'd like, waiting for the target creature to fall asleep.  When they do, the spells duration begins and you appear in their dreams. You can make conversation with them, but the creature is under no compulsion to speak with you and can handily boot you out of their dreams.

While interacting with a creature in a dream, you get a +2 bonus to skill checks.

{% hint style="info" %}
Creatures like elves with the trance racial feature always realize when they're being contacted by a dream spell. They can take a moment to center themselves, enter trance and allow the spell to take hold.
