You focus on a creature's aura to learn more information about them. Roll a CL check, DC 10+(creature's lvl). If you succeed, you can learn information from their aura, and even more by concentrating. Every round you learn a piece of information about it from the following list (caster's choice).

* Sexual Orientation
* Race/Species
* Gender
* Level
* Native Language
* Place of Origin (usually only general, like country)
* Age

You can only cast this spell on a given creature once per day.
