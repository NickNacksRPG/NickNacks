You deliver a message to a creature over any distance. In order to communicate with a creature, you must have met them, and you must know their name.

When you cast the spell, you telepathically communicate simple ideas that require no more than two sentences to convey (Monsters are attacking the north gate.  How do we respond?). Your target can reply with the same restrictions.

If your message is too complex or too long, the creature is dead, or the creature is on another plane then it gets lost in the ether and the caster takes 1 psychic damage.

You can only cast sending on a particular creature once each day unless you \[mana burn] 1.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast 3</mark> - By adding \[mana burn] you can instead have a conversation with this creature that either of you can cut off at any moment. The spells duration is instead 10 minutes.
