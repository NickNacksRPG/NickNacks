Tap into a creature’s memories and display them on a small screen so nearby creatures can also see what you experience.  Memories are viewed from the target’s perspective, so if they have impaired or inferior senses, so do you when you view the memory.

You must decide what specific memory or type of memory to view (ie. first kiss, 20th birthday party).  After you start viewing the memory in real time, you have the ability to skip ahead and rewind minutes at a time to better pinpoint important moments.

When cast on yourself or a willing creature, the duration increases to 1 hour and you can freely change what memories you look at on a whim, allowing for improved curation.

When you take damage or if the target moves more than 30 feet away from you, the spell ends. &#x20;

Cannot view magically altered memories.&#x20;
