You root around in the targets head, removing things and adding things to their memories. This spell has 2 functions.

<mark style="color:green;">Alter Memories</mark> - You can change details about memories, or add entirely new ones.

<mark style="color:green;">Remove Memories</mark> - You can completely remove memories of events.

In either case, you have to have at least a basic idea of what you're looking for (when they saw me break into that house, watching their spouse die in front of them). The spell can get very precise in its ability to alter memories, allowing you to remove specific items or creatures, but otherwise maintain everything else. The cast time of the spell is equal to the amount of memory that you want to change. 2 minutes of fighting you want to erase? 2 minutes of concentration.

For alterations that total longer than 5 minutes (including multiple strings of casts around the same time), the creature will fight to remember things that were altered or removed. When presented with contradictory evidence or otherwise prompted to think about these heavily modified memories, they get an additional save against the effect to restore their original memories.

When you take damage or if the target moves out of reach, the spell ends.
