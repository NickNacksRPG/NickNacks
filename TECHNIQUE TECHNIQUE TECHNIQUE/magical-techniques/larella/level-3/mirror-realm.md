This spell has two functions, trapping for combat and hosteling for shenanigans.  In either case, you must target a mirror.  When you do so, the contents of the mirror are set in stone and cease to reflect reality, instead creating its own little world that resembles what it reflected.

## <mark style="color:green;">Hosteling</mark>

You cast this version on a mirror in order to create an extradimensional space with some interesting quirks.  The space itself is a copy of everything within a 30ft distance from the mirror.  This means the mirror realm can capture entire rooms, including things that are hidden from line of sight (such as behind furniture) This allows your extradimensional space to contain furniture for instance.

No effects can come in or out of the mirror realm, but both sides can see what is on the other side of the mirror, barring any kind of physical obstructions that would prevent sight (such as drapery). By tapping on the mirror from either side you can cause the noise to carry over.

On casting the spell you can include a password that needs to be spoken in order to walk into the mirror (no action).  This password can be changed with 1 minute of concentration from the caster.  You can also update the mirror's appearance to keep it inconspicuous should the environment change drastically.  The caster can go blind and deaf temporarily to project their senses into the mirror realm at will indefinitely.

Objects cannot be brought out, nor can objects be brought in aside from what the average humanoid can reasonably carry on their person.  Any such objects left behind are shunted out, along with any creatures, if the mirror is destroyed or the spell ends.

Can be made permanent using 2,000g worth of powdered rare metals as an addition material component during casting

## <mark style="color:green;">Trapping</mark>

When casting the trapping form, you must target a creature AND an appropriately sized mirror (both of which need to be in range of you, but not each other).  If the creature fails its save, it is immediately sucked into the mirror (with a similar setting as the aforementioned hosteling effect).  No other creature can enter the mirror realm without another casting of this spell.

This does not prevent it from taking actions, but it can no longer interact with anything outside of the mirror realm, nor can any creature interact with the trapped individual.  The target is stranded.  They can see out of the mirror by standing next to it.  The only way they can escape is by having an ally destroy the mirror, or by waiting for 1 minute.  In either case, the creature appears in a random space within 15 feet of the mirror's line of sight.
