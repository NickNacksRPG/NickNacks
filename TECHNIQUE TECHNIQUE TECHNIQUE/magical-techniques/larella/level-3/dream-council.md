You enter a trance like state as you try to intercept the thoughts of up to 10 specific named sleeping creatures.  You can remain in this trance as long as you'd like, waiting for the target creature(s) to fall asleep.  When they do, you and any creatures you specify enter a shared dream space where you can make conversation with them. The creatures are under no compulsion to speak with you and can leave the dream space at any time.

Using the spell typically requires coordination beforehand in order to get everybody to attend the council. The duration of the spell starts when you contact at least one creature.

While interacting with a creature in a dream, you get a +2 bonus to skill checks.
