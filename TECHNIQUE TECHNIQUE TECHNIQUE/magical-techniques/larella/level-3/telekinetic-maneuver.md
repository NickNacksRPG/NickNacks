As part of casting the spell and as a standard action for the spells duration, you can perform a combat maneuver using (CL+3) as your bonus. Some maneuvers work slightly differently as noted below.

<mark style="color:green;">Drag</mark> - Move the creature to another position within the spells range, up to 30 ft.

<mark style="color:green;">Grapple</mark> - While grappling, this spell also has the \[concentration] tag. Instead of dealing the damage of a held weapon, you instead deal 2d6+CL (7+CL) crush dmg each turn. You must spend your standard action to do this each turn or the grapple ends.

You are not entangled while grappling. You do not need to pull the target adjacent to you. Any damage you take while concentrating also deals poise damage. If poise broken or moved out of range, this effect ends.
