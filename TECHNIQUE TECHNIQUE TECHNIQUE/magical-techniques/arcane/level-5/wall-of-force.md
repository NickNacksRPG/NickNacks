You create a wall of shimmering force. It is transparent, giving you line of sight, but blocks line of effect and deflects all attacks. It has 50 hp and dissipates if this hp is lost.&#x20;

A creature can attempt to pass through the wall by making a reflex save as a free action. Failure deals 2d8+CL (9+CL) force damage to them.
