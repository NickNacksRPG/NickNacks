You can cause a copy of a held melee weapon made entirely out of magic force to form slowly, float above your head and follow you at a fixed distance. At any point on your next turn, launch it at a target of your choosing within 20 ft. Make a ranged attack as though making a thrown attack. It deals the damage of a standard melee attack but as force damage.

By casting this spell as a standard action, you can reduce its mana cost to 1.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage of the sword by d8 (4).
