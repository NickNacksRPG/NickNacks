Fire a magical projectile that homes in on a specific target and follows it around, damaging each time it passes through. The projectile moves 30 ft each round and stops when it reaches the targets space, dealing 3d8+CL (13+CL) force damage (reflex halves). If the target does not move out of range, it takes the damage repeatedly at the start of each of your turns.

The projectile moves in a straight line from its starting position to the target. If it impacts solid terrain during its travel, it dissipates harmlessly. It cannot harm any creature other than the original target.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, increase damage by d8 (4).
