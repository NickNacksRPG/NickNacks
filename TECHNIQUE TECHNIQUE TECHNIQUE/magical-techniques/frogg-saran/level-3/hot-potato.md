You cause a smoldering potato to appear in a creatures free hands, in their pocket, or otherwise lodged on their person. It is uncomfortable to the touch, but does not deal damage. It vibrates and pulses with greater intensity as time passes, culminating into a powerful condensed explosion on the 3rd round, dealing 6d12+CL (33+CL) fire damage to whoever is holding it.

The potato must be possessed by someone, and can only be removed by the creature who currently has it giving it to someone else as a standard action, requiring a successful attack roll or poise break.

For clarity...

Turn 1 - Cast Spell\
Turn 2 - nothin'\
Turn 3 - Explodes violently at the end of your turn
