You change the pupils of your eyes to match that of the mysterious serpent Sneko, afflicting you with its curse. Whenever you spend mana, roll a d4.

<mark style="color:green;">1</mark> - The mana cost is decreased by 2\
<mark style="color:green;">2</mark> - The mana cost is decreased by 1\
<mark style="color:green;">3</mark> - The mana cost is increased by 1\
<mark style="color:green;">4</mark> - The mana cost is increased by 2

You can choose to spend mana in excess to your current mana as long as you could _potentially_ reduce the mana cost to your remaining mana or less. If the mana cost exceeds your remaining mana, you mana burn the excess. If the mana reduction exceeds the mana cost, you regain mana.

To remove the curse, you must T-pose and perform no actions for 1 full round.
