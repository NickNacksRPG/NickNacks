You transform a creature into a frog. Permanently. The **caster** is unable to attack, cast any spells that affect this frog or otherwise harm it in any way, even when magically compelled to do so.  The creature gains the following qualities.

| Mad Hops | Increase the distance the jump action brings you by 10 ft.   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tongue   | Make combat maneuvers to drag at 30 ft range without penalty |
| Smol     | Decrease size tiny.  Decrease reach to 0.                    |
| Speed    | Gain a swim speed                                            |

Another creature must spend their standard action to kiss the frog to transform it back. The un-frogged creature is dazed on its next turn and charmed by the creature who kissed it for 8 hours. This secondary effect is a \[charm] effect.
