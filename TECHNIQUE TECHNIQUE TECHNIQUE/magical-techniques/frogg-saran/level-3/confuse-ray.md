A ray of light shines down on a point, and mysterious motes of light fly around and distort creatures' perception of the world around them. Any creature that starts its turn inside of, or moves into the ray of light becomes confused (will adds 4 to confusion rolls).

You can direct this light as a standard action on subsequent turns, moving it 20 feet in a straight line. All creatures along its path are subject to its effect.
