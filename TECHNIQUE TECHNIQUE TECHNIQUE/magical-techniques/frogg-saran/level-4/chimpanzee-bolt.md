You summon a chimpanzee, functioning as a medium sized [harambe](https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/bestiary/beasts/harambe), and it immediately flies at high speeds towards the target of this spell. Make a ranged attack that deals 5d8+CL (22+CL) crush damage.&#x20;

Hit or miss, the chimp lands adjacent to the target. During the first turn you summon it, you can command it to better strategize. Every turn after it attacks creatures randomly until it is defeated, focusing on whatever creature is closest.
