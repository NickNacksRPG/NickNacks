You make a cheesy sacrifice to the god of madness. He blesses you by generating a storm of cheesy goodness. Cheese wheels fall from the sky, damaging friend, foe and terrain alike.  Any creature without some kind of cover from the harsh weather takes (CL) crush damage at the start of each of their turns.

The effect on the surrounding terrain varies based on how durable it is.  Many settlements will experience broken windows and plenty of casualties. But with great sacrifice comes great reward: This spell generates a mountain of edible cheese.
