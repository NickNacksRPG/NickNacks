You laugh maniacally and revel in the chaos. All creatures in the radius of the spell MUST make a simple attack with a melee weapon against the nearest creature. If they do not have a means to attack, then the spell does not affect them.  \
The order that creatures make the attacks is as follows: The caster, his allies, neutral parties, his enemies.

The caster is allowed to use a special attack instead of a simple attack.
