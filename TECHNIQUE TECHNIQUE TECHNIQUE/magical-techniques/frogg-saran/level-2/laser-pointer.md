You use your finger to point at something and a little red light appears on the surface in the space of a creature. The creature is entranced by this tiny red light (will negates, mindless creatures and animal intelligence get a -2 penalty to this save). If the creature is not in combat then it follows the light with a playful curiosity, trying to catch it. The creature will not go anywhere it is incapable or that is inherently dangerous.

You must spend a standard action each turn to maintain the light. When you do, you can move the light up to 30 feet a round to guide the creature's movement.

If the creature is currently engaged in combat, they spend their move action following the light, but still have any other actions.
