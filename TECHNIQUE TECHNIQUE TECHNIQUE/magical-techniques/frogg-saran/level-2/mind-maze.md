You alter a target's perception to make it think it needs to move in specific directions around invisible walls in order to reach it's intended location. At the start of the creatures turn, it moves 15 ft in a random direction, even if that brings them to a very dangerous position, such as off a cliff.

Aside from this movement, the creature is unable to move further. If something prevents the creature from moving, such as being snared, then it does not move.
