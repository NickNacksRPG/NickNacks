You conjure a spectral frog that slowly jumps towards an enemy. Each round it moves 20 feet closer to the target. Once it moves into the targets space, it explodes in a cloud of toxic gas, dealing 2d8+CL (9+CL) poison damage (fort halves). If it survives its first turn without hitting its target, it deals an additional 10 damage when it explodes.

The frog does not take into consideration difficult terrain, and will hop directly into the air towards a foe. It cannot pass through walls and will move around them if the target moves out of sight.

If a creature enters the space of a frog, willingly or unwillingly, then it immediately explodes.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent (max 2 additional mana) increase the damage d8 (4) and add another frog that targets a different creature.
