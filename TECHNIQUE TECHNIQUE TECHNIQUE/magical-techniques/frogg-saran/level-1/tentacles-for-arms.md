One of your arms transforms into several muscular writhing tentacles, reaching for nearby creatures autonomously. At the end of each turn, they roll a grapple attack with a +4 bonus against a random creature within your natural reach, even if you are unable to act. If you do not threaten a creature, then they grapple you.

You cannot willingly end a grapple made by the tentacles.
