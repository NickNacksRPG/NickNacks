You enchant a friendly frog to give off an aura of excellence, as though it were rich, famous or well renowned. People treat this frog as though it were a person of high importance, accommodating for its small stature whenever they can.

You can give this frog a set of simplistic orders such as "enter that restaurant and buy a steak" or "pretend to be a lifeguard at the beach." It will dutifully perform these tasks to the best of its ability.

Only creatures that directly interact with the frog get a save against the enchantment (ie the waiter or someone the lifeguard saves). Creatures who are level 0, or who are minions to you do not get a save.

If you cast the spell again, the frog harms anyone or someone kisses the frog, the spell ends.
