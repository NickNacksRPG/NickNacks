You launch a wave of rainbow of energy. All creatures in the area take 6d8+CL (27+CL) force damage, then roll a bonus effect for each individual creature (reflex halves the damage and negates the additional effect).

The rainbow persists for three rounds, creatures that enter the area of the rainbow or end of their turn inside of it must make additional saves. You can walk on the rainbow as though it were a solid object without issue.
