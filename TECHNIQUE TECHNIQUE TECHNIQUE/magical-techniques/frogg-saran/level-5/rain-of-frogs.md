A bunch of storm clouds roll in, even while indoors, and rain hundreds of frogs upon the area. The situation grows more dire with each passing round at the start of your turn.

<mark style="color:green;">Round 1</mark> - A mere frog drizzle. The area is considered difficult terrain to any non frog creatures.

<mark style="color:green;">Round 2</mark> - A frog downpour. The area is considered impassable terrain for any non frog creatures. Any non frog creatures still in the area are entangled, unable to effectively move through the lake of frogs.

<mark style="color:green;">Round 3</mark> - A frognado. The frogs, and any creature in the area of the spell is lifted into the air and thrown 60 feet in a random direction. The frogs quickly dissipate afterwords. Any other creatures and objects are staggered for 3 rounds and take 6d10+CL (33+CL) crush damage.
