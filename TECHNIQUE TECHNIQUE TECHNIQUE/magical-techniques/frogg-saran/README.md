# Frogg Saran

Ever since his rebranding from the god of death back in the old days, Frogg has grown a lot more popular.

Frogg Saran is chaos incarnate. He is known to give blessings and curses in equal measure.  Frogg Saron is a very active force in the world of Nack, worming his way into many peoples lives whether they like it or not. All this god seeks is to increase the amount of entropy in the universe.  His followers start riots and revolutions merely to change the status quo. They reincarnate people for funsies just to see the reaction to their new body.

Frogg spells are categorized by their randomness and propensity to inflict madness or strange behavior, generally favoring the caster.
