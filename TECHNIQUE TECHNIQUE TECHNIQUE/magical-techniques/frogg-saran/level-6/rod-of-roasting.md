You plant your staff into the ground and it ignites in flames. The flames take the shape of a frog and start laughing maniacally, telling a joke or saying proverbs unfit for the current situation.

At the end of each of your turns, the frog launches an intense fireblast at a creature within 60 ft, chosen randomly between all creatures. Creatures takes 10d8+CL (45+CL) fire damage (reflex halves). Touching or trying to physically move the stick also triggers this effect.&#x20;

If you are the last one standing within a 60 ft radius of the rod when the spell ends, you refund the the mana cost of this spell, you gain a luck dice, your staff returns to you and you gain 40 temp hp.
