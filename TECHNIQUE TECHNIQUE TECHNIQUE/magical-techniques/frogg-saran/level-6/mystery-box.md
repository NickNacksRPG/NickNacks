You form a direct conduit with Frogg himself, allowing his magic to flow through you. Roll to select a random spell list, then cast a random spell of each spell level on that spell list (up to fifth level). Targets of these spells are chosen randomly from all legal targets. If a spell generates an area of effect then it chooses a creature randomly to center this effect on. If a spell does not have a suitable target then it fizzles, producing no effect.

You are always considered a willing and available target for all effects that can affect your creature type. Frogs and frog-like creatures are fair game for this spell.

A target is considered "legal" if its targeting is allowed. For example, if you roll the Frogg spell list and get [lucky star](../level-1/lucky-star.md), you count the number of creatures in range, then roll randomly to see who gets targeted. However, if you roll necromancy and get [corpse explosion](../../necromancy/level-3/corpse-explosion.md), but you donâ€™t control any undead, there are no corpses within range and you aren't undead yourself, then that particular spell fizzles.
