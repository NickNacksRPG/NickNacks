As long as you maintain concentration and contact with a body of written text, you can continue to absorb information from it. You can effectively summarize a book without even opening it at a rate of 10 standard pages a minute, even if you don't understand it's language.

If the text is encoded, you only interpret its literal meaning. This spell allows you to get the gist of anything written in a secret language.
