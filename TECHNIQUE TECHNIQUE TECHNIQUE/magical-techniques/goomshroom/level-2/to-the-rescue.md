Your hands ooze with a soothing and sticky goo. Take the carry action and increase your speed by 20 this turn. You ignore their weight as though it were your own. Any creature touched recovers (5+CL) hp. You can rescue up to 2 allies.  At the end of your turn, they detach in an adjacent space of your choosing, or in your possession.

If a creature is directly preventing an ally from moving, such as when being grappled, then you cannot rescue them. For situations like being stuck in a web, a suitable check (like athletics) can be rolled to rescue.
