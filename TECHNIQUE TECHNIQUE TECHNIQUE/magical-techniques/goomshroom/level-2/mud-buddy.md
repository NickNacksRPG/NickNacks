You sculpt mud into a more friendly shape, and your new buddy does his best to aid you. Mud buddy is an elemental that shares all of your ability scores, poise, AC and saves. He has half of your max hp. He shares your level, but is always treated as a minion.

Mud buddy cannot wield weapons, and his only form of attack is a single topple every turn. He has a 20 land speed and a 60 swim speed. He can burrow through moist earth using his land speed.

Outside of combat he can do simple tasks, such as physical labor. He is intelligent, but he lacks the ability to speak and has no skills. He can carry 300 lbs.
