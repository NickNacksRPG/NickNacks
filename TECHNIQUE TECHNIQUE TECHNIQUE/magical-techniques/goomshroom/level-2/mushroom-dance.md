Choose an adjacent creature to start dancing around. If you remain adjacent to the creature for the entire cast time, you learn about their lifestyle by gleaning one of three general categories.

<mark style="color:green;">Sin</mark> - They kill, lie, cheat, steal or deal with demons/undead

<mark style="color:green;">Neutral</mark> - They have no strong tendencies towards sin or virtue, or roughly equal measures of both

<mark style="color:green;">Virtuous</mark> - They are honest. They save the lives of innocents and lend aid to the weak and downtrodden
