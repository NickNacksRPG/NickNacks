You conjure up an extra-dimensional meadow that can be accessed from a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a circle of toadstools enclosing a 10ft circle. The meadow itself is a one mile radius. Only those you designate can enter through the portal. You can designate a creature by carving its name into a special tree inside of the meadow. As a standard action you can banish a creature from your dimension.

Once a visitor has passed through the entry point, they find themselves in an idyllic twilight meadow decorated with mushrooms surrounded by an impassable grove. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

The caster can configure the meadow into any shape desires with rolling hills and flowing rivers. The place is comfortable and temperate. The trees can provide enough food to sustain 20 people a day. A staff of 10 spectral animal or fey-like servants wait upon all who enter. They can perform simple tasks and can go anywhere in the meadow.

Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the meadow, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.

A caster can only have one instance of this spell active at once. If they cast the spell again, it only moves the portal. Because this is a physical tangible location, things can be brought in and out of the portal. Like all extra-dimensional spaces, creatures can use plane shift (wild card 4) to teleport directly into the plane.
