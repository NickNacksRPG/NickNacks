You take a bottle and you think of somebody that you know at least by name and have met as you place it into a source of water: A bucket, a lake, a toilet, as long as the bottle can be submerged, it counts. This bottle disappears and then appears near the creature you thought of and floats towards them in a bubble. If the creature is near no suitable water sources then it only appears when the creature gets nearby one. After (presumably) reading the message, the creature can write their own message and send the bottle back to you.

Anything that can reasonably fit into a tiny bottle can also be included.  This spell does not function across planes.

This spell does not require line of sight.
