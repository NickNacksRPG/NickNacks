You blow a bubble in the shape of a friend. It floats gently in the air or water behind you at a static distance of 10 ft. It cannot be popped unless it takes piercing damage from a direct attack.

Gives all nearby allies +2 happiness.

Bubble buddy has nothing but the best intentions but often somehow finds a way to sour the mood. At any point while bubble buddy exists, you can send it into a social situation. People will generally treat bubble buddy as a real person, but it does not speak much back, only communicating vaguely through subtle item interactions. Over the course of a minute, bubble buddy will quickly inconvenience people to show what a bad possible outcome is for interacting with this specific person or type of person. Such as spilling a dwarf's drink, or poking someone very sensitive to touch.

If you allow it, bubbly buddy will continue interacting with people all around a social setting, such as a party, a tavern etc and ruin the mood. After which, people will turn on the buddy (and the caster if they saw you cast it, see you concentrating etc).
