You exude an aura that allows creatures to exist in worlds they are no used to. Every creature that can see you (or sense you) gains the amphibious quality, allowing them to comfortably adapt to either land or sea, no matter which they normally prefer. Sea creatures gain a 30 ft land speed and land creatures gain a 30 ft swim speed.

This quality persists for as long as they stay near you, but it does not immediately disappear. The boon persists for (CL\*10) minutes after the creature cannot see you.

Most churches dedicated to [The Shroomlette](https://app.gitbook.com/s/qFzTamwcoNEgFoEbLz7c/gods/earthly-deities/shroomlette) are persistently affected by this aura.
