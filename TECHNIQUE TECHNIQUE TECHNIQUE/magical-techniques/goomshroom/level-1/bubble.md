Blow a bubble large enough to carry the target(s) of the spell. The bubble can carry any amount of weight, and can even hold sharp objects without popping. The bubble trails behind you, matching your speed, automatically avoiding obstacles and bouncing against surfaces. You can toggle whether the bubble follows you on and off as a free action.

The only way the bubble can be popped is ceasing concentration, dispel magic or a creature spending a standard action to poke the bubble.

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast 5</mark> - The bubble carries up to 15x15x15 of space
