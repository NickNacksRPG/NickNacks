Your skin oozes a gooey substance. Whenever you touch a willing creature (free action), your initiative now matches theirs. This does not give you an additional turn, but you can use any movement you have left to ride into battle with the touched creature. Simply by touching them, you can allow a creature of any size to mount you as though you were appropriately sized. You ignore their weight as though it were your own. Any effects that create forced movement automatically moves all attached creatures if you are affected, and have no effect on mounted creatures if you aren't affected.

If you attach to multiple creatures, you all must choose one creature's initiative to attach to.

You can also use the carry action without making allies clumsy.

By applying a solvent or making an athletics check (spell dc) as a standard action you can be forcefully separated. The caster can choose to release stuck creatures at any time as a free action.
