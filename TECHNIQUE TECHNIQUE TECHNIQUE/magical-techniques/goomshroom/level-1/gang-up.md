You create 3 slimy copies of yourself that relentlessly follow a creature of your choosing (even into areas you couldnâ€™t go, such as into the air). While they persist, they each take up a single space adjacent to the creature most optimal to provide flanking. If they are targeted with a hostile attack, spell or take any damage, they disappear. Their movement is \[elusive].

These duplicates are treated as though they have all teamwork feats.
