# Goomshroom

The Shoomlette is an entity that represents the bond between gooms, a breed of squishy draconic creatures, and shroomkin, a race of people with close ties to fey and mushrooms.  These two entities live in tandem with each other with one main goal: increase the quantity of happiness in the world.  The tactics they use to do so is to subdue creatures that decrease happiness and physically change the world around them to make it a better place to live.

Shroomlette spells either inspire teamwork or incapacitate creatures in some way, often through the manipulation of water. Includes many oddities mimicking the special abilities of gooms and shrooms.
