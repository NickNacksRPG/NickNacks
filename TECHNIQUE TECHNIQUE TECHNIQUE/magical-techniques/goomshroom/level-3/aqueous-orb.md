You open a portal to the elemental planes to generate a large size (10x10 ft) orb of water. Immediately upon casting the spell, and as a swift action each turn, you can move the orb up to 30 ft in a straight line. If the orb moves through a creature's space, then it is carried along for the ride and made wet (reflex negates).

When picked up or at the end of each turn it is carried, creatures take 2d8+CL (9+CL) poise damage and are made clumsy 2. Spell DC athletics as a swift action to escape.
