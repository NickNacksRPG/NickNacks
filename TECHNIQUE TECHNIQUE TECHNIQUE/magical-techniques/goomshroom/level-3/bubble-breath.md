You blow a bunch of bubbles. Affected creatures are trapped inside of a bubble for 3 rounds (reflex negates). The bubble is completely indestructible and cannot be popped, moved or altered in any way from the inside. Trapped creatures are free to take any actions they please, the only restriction being that they cannot affect creatures outside of the bubble. They can use teleportation to escape or use the reprieve to heal and buff.&#x20;

The reverse is also true: Creatures outside of the bubble cannot affect creatures inside of the bubble without first popping it. Bubbles can only be popped by taking 1 pierce damage.

Because of the defensive properties of the bubble, hitting allies with it to protect them is a viable strategy. Allies do not need to roll a reflex save. They can choose to be affected by the spell or not, even while defeated.
