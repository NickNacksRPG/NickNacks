# Demigod

You are well known and beloved/feared throughout the land through your deeds and people worship the ground you walk on. You defeated a demigod previously and absorbed their power. \
Through some means you have literally ascended to godhood.

Gain the following benefitsâ€¦\
<mark style="color:green;">Deific Boons</mark> - Take a T1 boon from another god, or make one up. You and creatures that choose you as their god gain this benefit. By achieving even greater (story/world related) feats, you can acquire greater boons.

<mark style="color:green;">Emissary</mark> -  Form a summoning contract with your chosen one. The creature must be level 10 or lower. You can telepathically communicate with this creature over any distance.

<mark style="color:green;">Prayers Answered</mark> - You can innately cast sending (Larella 1) upcast to 3rd level so long as it is to communicate with to any of your followers.

<mark style="color:green;">Deific Aspect</mark> - You can project yourself anywhere you have seen, as though you had been summoned via summoning contract. This requires a 1 minute cast time with a very obvious physical phenomenon occurring to indicate your imminent arrival, such as storm clouds, whirlpool, magic circle (something appropriate for you) during the cast time. You do not need to know the location if your followers pray for your assistance. You are not drained if you gain summoning sickness. Otherwise this has a cooldown of 1 day.
