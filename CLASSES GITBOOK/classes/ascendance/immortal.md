# Immortal

You have harnessed the power of a powerful artifact. You have received the blessing of a god. You have unlocked forbidden magics. Through some means, you have managed to figure out how to prevent aging for yourself.

Gain the following benefitsâ€¦\
<mark style="color:green;">Timeless</mark> - You cannot die of old age, nor can you be forced to magically age. You can alter your age to appear as a younger or older version of yourself, going anything from your prime to an elderly form. Changing requires a standard action.

<mark style="color:green;">Optional</mark> - You no longer need to drink, eat, sleep, breathe or anything else tied to your biology that requires your continued operation. You must still must only do light physical/mental activity in order to rest. You can still do any of these things if you so choose.

<mark style="color:green;">Ex Machina</mark> - Whenever you are slain, you automatically resurrect 1 day later at a pre-designated significant location, such as your hometown or primary place of worship. This ability goes on cool down for 1 month. If you die during this time, you stay dead.
