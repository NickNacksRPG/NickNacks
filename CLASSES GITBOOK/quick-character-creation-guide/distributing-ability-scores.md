# Distributing Ability Scores

Read the core mechanics section in order to get a better understanding of the function of each ability score. Every character gets starting 6 points to invest in their ability scores as they wish/ Every point you increase in ability score counts against this total.\
You can decrease an ability score to -1 in order to gain an additional point. The maximum points you can invest is 3. The minimum is -1.
