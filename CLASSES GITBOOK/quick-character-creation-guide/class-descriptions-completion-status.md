<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="158"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alchemist (ND)</td><td>The scientist class. One of the more versatile classes that allows you to specialize in different types of fighting. Specialize in poisons, bombs, physical augmentations and more!<br>Every single alchemist is completely unique thanks to their scientific discoveries.</td></tr><tr><td>Beast Trainer (ND)</td><td>The class name says it all: Form a close bond with a special animal uniquely trained to fight by your side. Beast companions can be tailored to fit very specific niches, or you can make a really big dino that chomps people. Also comes with a side of nature magic.</td></tr><tr><td>Blood Hunter (P)</td><td>A gunman with a crimson tint. You can sacrifice your life to continuously fire your firearm for massive damage. You fight to the last breath and hunt those that escape the bite of your bullets.</td></tr><tr><td>Barbarian (C)</td><td>The true bruiser class. The barbarian is designed to run straight into the middle of the battlefield all alone as their optimal strategy. They specialize in taking and dealing damage and equal measure, as well as disrupting the battlefield with combat maneuvers and raw strength, often in ridiculous ways.</td></tr><tr><td>Bard (P)</td><td>The cheerleader class. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but the bard is primarily concerned with supporting their team by inspiring them with tunes. Bards are at home in the middle of their team where they can provide the most benefit. They often excel in social situations. Their performances assure that whatever hijinks your party gets up to goes down in history.</td></tr><tr><td>Bender (C)</td><td>The elemental class. Based largely off of the "Avatar: The Last Airbender" and "Legend of Korra" anime. Based off of what element you choose, you will get a variety of abilities tailored to manipulating that element. Airbenders are mobile with the ability to glide and eventually fly. Firebenders specialize in dealing damage. Earthbenders are tough to keep down and bend the element with the most utility. Water benders are the best generalists with decent durability, healing and CC.</td></tr><tr><td>Druid (C)</td><td>The nature mage class. Focus on a particular element of nature, like beasts, plants, insects or fungi. This choice informs the nature of many of your class features. The druid excels in off-road adventures to the uninhabited corners of the world.</td></tr><tr><td>Fiend  Shifter (C)</td><td>The demon class. Tailor yourself towards one specific type of fiend as they are depicted in folklore and popular media. Demons primarily deal in destruction, and grow to monstrous sizes with extra demon parts to get the job done. Devils primarily deal in deals, using the power of persuasion to lock people into promises as well as lock them in place. There are more, but I'll leave it at that for brevity.</td></tr><tr><td>Fighter  (C)</td><td>Do they even really need a description? Your standard warrior class whose primary asset is their mastery over their equipment. Archetypes give variety in your game plan whether its zone control with Dark Knight, dueling with Swashbuckler or horde slaying with Aran.</td></tr><tr><td>Hero (P)</td><td>A class based off of the sillyness encountered in the Oldschool Runescape MMORPG. It is very flexible, with an emphasis on adding tons of new abilities that interact with skills, similar to the signature skill feat.</td></tr><tr><td>Healer (P)</td><td>The true support class. Provides the invaluable resource of healing, whether it means hitpoints, poisons or whatever other strange ailments that befall adventures.</td></tr><tr><td>Jester (P)</td><td>Bard felt too general for me, so they're primarily musicians now. Jesters are kind of an inbetween for bard and rogue. Part martial, part mage, with tons of supernatural abilities that allow them to get into and out of trouble based on acting, prestidigitation style magic and miming.</td></tr><tr><td>Lunatic  (C)</td><td>The wild magic class. A full blown magic caster class similar to 5e's wild magic sorcerer. This class is meant to be a complete joke as far as flavor text goes. If you want your character to be completely unpredictable and completely insane, this is the one for you. Praise Frogg!</td></tr><tr><td>Light Guardian (P)</td><td>Light guardians are duty-bound to protect the world from the seemingly endless onslaught of fiends and mages who would take advantage of others. A very simple martial support class centered around preventing and protecting against magic.</td></tr><tr><td>Martial Artist  (C)</td><td>The unarmed class. Your primary asset is your body and your spirit. Martial artists require no equipment in order to be functional, replacing weapons and armor with years of rigorous training. This class covers everything from monks to wrestlers.</td></tr><tr><td>Magus (ND)</td><td>The spell sword class. Not quite fighter not, quite wizard, the magus specializes in dealing damage with magic via their weapons. They get unique abilities that allow them to combine spells and attacks.</td></tr><tr><td>Maligner (C)</td><td>A class with a very specific theme. You no longer exist. Instead you are a set of interchangeable and replaceable personas. There is no "real you." Most of the maligner's abilities are centered around deceit through illusions, enchantments and transformations.</td></tr><tr><td>Mechanic (ND)</td><td> The mecha class. Has 2 variants: pilot and suitor. Pilots are the mecha classic where you hop into an oversized robot and use that for fighting, transportation etc. Suitors prefer a technologically advanced body suit (a la metroid) that enhances their combat prowess and comes with all kinds of useful adaptations and gadgets.</td></tr><tr><td>Mesmerist  (C)</td><td>The hypnotist class. You have a very special pair of eyes that allow you to break the mental barriers of creatures just by staring at them. You cast spells that manipulate the minds of others and have a special set of psychic implants that you can use to create contingent effects like seeing through another creature's eyes or turning them into a sleeper cell.</td></tr><tr><td>Necromancer  (C)</td><td>The undead master class. Every enemy that you defeat you are able to transform into an allied skeleton or zombie. Your abilities allow you to better maintain these creatures and also makes them more powerful. There are variants that are more catered towards a magic caster playstyle, and others that encourage you to get into the thick of things with your undead minions.</td></tr><tr><td>Psychic  (C)</td><td>The psionic class. Your psychic powers allow you to manipulate objects with your mind, gaze into the minds of others and even manipulate their memories. There is a variant that specializes in the telekinesis, throwing objects (and creatures) around the battlefield. Another that specializes in scrying: A type of advanced magical spying technique that allows you to hear and see things from great distances. Another in reading and toying with the future.</td></tr><tr><td>Rogue  (P)</td><td>The class that isn't afraid to use underhanded tactics. Rogue specialize in stealthy operations, are good with their hands and have high mobility. Rogues can be masterminds, creating nebulous plans that fall into place precisely when needed. Rogues can also be common thugs, specializing in bullying and intimidation.</td></tr><tr><td>Shapeshifter  (C)</td><td>The animal transformer class. The shapeshifter has the ability to take on any number of features from different types of creatures, but mostly animals. They can choose to go an anthropomorphic hybrid mode, growing claws and jaws werewolf style, or they can choose to completely transform into animals. The wide variety of features that a shapeshifter can use and the swiftness of the transformations allows them to adapt to the situation on the fly.</td></tr><tr><td>Summoner  (???)</td><td>The pokemon trainer class. The summoner summons a unique creature called an eidolon that fights by their side. As the summoner grows more powerful, they are able to shape the course of the creatures evolution, allowing them to create completely unique abominations from other realms. Outside of the eidolon, they're also able to summon other weaker creatures to supplement their main damage source.</td></tr><tr><td>Slayer (P)</td><td>The Doom class. Based largely off of the games "Doom: 2016" and "Doom Eternal." You are a one-man army with a deadly arsenal of unique guns, melee weapons and supernatural powers almost entirely dedicated to killing things. Even without these weapons, your fists are usually enough to get the job done.</td></tr><tr><td>Virtuoso  (P)</td><td>Another unique gun wielding class. Primarily based off of the league of legends character Jhin. The virtuoso has a certain flair to their combat, creating flashy displays out of their gunplay. Fear the 4th shot.</td></tr><tr><td>Wizard  (ND)</td><td>The magic caster with the biggest brain. Wizards possess the unique ability to memorize their spells on the fly. Given enough time for preparation, a skilled wizard can overcome any problem, including creating entirely new spells.</td></tr><tr><td>Zealot (C)</td><td>The crusader class. Zealots are shielded by their faith in god as much as their armor. They always take the moral high ground and have mercy for other creatures. Some creatures though, like undead and demons, are beyond redemption, and must be eliminated by using their divine powers to smite them into oblivion.</td></tr></tbody></table>
