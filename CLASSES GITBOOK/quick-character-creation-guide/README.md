# Quick Character Creation Guide

{% hint style="warning" %}
Read [main character status](main-character-status.md)! It is essential for character creation.
{% endhint %}

There are several things for you to decide when deciding what you're writing down on your character sheet. Start with a theme, aesthetic, fighting style, or a particular character you want to mimic from popular media.

There's nothing wrong with working backwards, but in general, I listed things from most important to least important when it comes to making your character sheet and starting to play.

***

&#x20;**You should probably start with…**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="64"></th><th width="85"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Class</td><td><p>The way that I've designed classes has generally been pretty specific in terms of theme. Some classes come with archetypes (subclasses).</p><p>Some classes have choices pre-built in, like what type of techniques you know, a martial artist's fighting style or a necromancer's starting minion.</p></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/EKVEWQG0W87J8YCOQDO5/s/RMbLojcVzvAZ0Dwd2Vjs/">Race</a></td><td>Races come with a variety of benefits. Primary race features help define what role they generally fit, while secondary features are generally more interchangeable.<br>Human is kind of the "default" which is generally good for all characters and isn't very difficult to role play.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Ability Scores</td><td>Read up on what each of them do since they are all useful at a baseline! How you determine your stats is in the <a href="distributing-ability-scores.md">distributing ability scores</a> subsection.</td></tr></tbody></table>

&#x20;**Then after that…**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="66"></th><th width="122"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td><a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/EKVEWQG0W87J8YCOQDO5/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/">Skills</a></td><td>Skills generally determine the type of things that your character does that are less specific. Rogues and ninjas might be known for stealth, but anybody can take the skill. Most skills are tailored towards out of combat interactions, but some like athletics, stealth and acrobatics have a variety of applications.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/EKVEWQG0W87J8YCOQDO5/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/">Feat(s)</a></td><td>Feats are customization options that usually give static bonuses, new options in combat, and generally serve to tailor your character towards a specific play style.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><a href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/approximating-golds-value/background">Background</a></td><td>This section helps inform what your character was up to before they became an adventurer and provides you with unique sets of starting gear.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/EKVEWQG0W87J8YCOQDO5/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/">Equips</a></td><td>Decide what type of weapon/armor you want.<br>All character start off with 1,000g to spend as they wish as well as a jizzle physick (details also in equipment).</td></tr></tbody></table>

&#x20;**Then finally…**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="67"></th><th width="112"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>8</td><td>Backstory</td><td>Think about what your character wants, the kinds of tie-ins they have to your world and the kinds of tragic events that happened that led to them brooding in corners of bars.<br>Writing back stories can be fun, but you shouldn't feel obligated to write a specific number of pages or wordcount like it's some silly school assignment. How much you put into table top is how much you get out of it.<br>The most important part of character design is making sure you, your DM and your players are all interested, or at the very least not annoyed, by your character.</td></tr><tr><td>9?</td><td><a href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/EuW2xQOuMIcaalg1YNV3/character-creation">Random Charts</a></td><td>Under the random charts section, there is a "character creation" tab that allows you to decide details about your character if you are uncertain about how big or small, old or young you want your character to be.</td></tr></tbody></table>
