# Firebending Style

Features with a number require being at least that level. (17 total features)\
Reminder: All effects are (Su) and have the \[fire] or \[zap] tag, as appropriate.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Human Torch \[light]</mark>

By manifesting a mote of flame, a fiery halo, flaming hair etc, you can give off light in a 20 ft radius. By spending a swift action, you can increase the radius of the bright light to 60 ft for 1 round.\
You can turn this ability on or off 1/round as an instant action.

By spending 1 mana as a swift action, you can end this ability to blind all creatures within your natural reach for 1 round (reflex reduces to blurred vision). This part of the ability can only be used 1/combat.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Fire Rush \[elusive]</mark>

As a standard action, you can move 30 ft (even into the air) with a sudden burst of fire and make a blast attack against a creature within reach along the way.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Melt (1)</mark>

Whenever you are entombed, frosty, wet, entangled or something similar, you can spend an immediate action to automatically melt any solid material that contains you, removing the condition. If the effect is intangible magic, attempt to dispel it (as though using elemental counter, even if you donâ€™t have it yet).

If you start your turn grappled, deal blast damage to all grappling creatures as a free action.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Trailblaze \[persistent]</mark>

When you take the dash or disengage action, you can leave behind a trail of flames. Creatures that walk through these spaces are set ablaze (reflex negates).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Will 'o' Wisp</mark>

Your blast causes foes to glow vibrantly and applies a -10 penalty to stealth on hit for 1 minute. Further attacks against this creature ignore partial concealment and treats total concealment as partial concealment.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Blistering Feint</mark>

When you successfully feint a creature, they are set ablaze.\
By spending 2 mana, you can feint as a swift action.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Flamethrower \[persistent]</mark>

Your elemental wave feature is persistent until the start of your next turn. You cannot change its direction, even if you move during it.

A random space occupied by the target of your elemental blast is set on fire. Creatures that move into this space are set ablaze. The creature you initially attacked is only set ablaze immediately if they end their turn in this space.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Delayed Blast \[concentration]</mark>&#x20;

You can fire an elemental blast that doesn't require an attack roll and doesn't do any damage. It leaves a tiny flame behind that you can choose to explode at any point within the next minute as an instant action. The explosion does blast damage in a 10 ft radius (reflex halves). If you don't choose to make it explode within a minute, it fizzles.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Fire Rune (2) \[sigil]</mark>

You can singe a fiery rune onto a surface that lasts until it is activated. Common things include things people frequently interact with like doors and books. When a creature gets within 5 ft of this rune and there is line of effect, it explodes in a 5ft radius, dealing blast damage (reflex halves). You can have a number of runes equal to your level and you are mentally alerted which one activates when they explode or are disabled.

A fiery rune can be avoided by covering it, scratching at it with a long object or destroying the object it's written on. Perception DC is class DC to notice when put in plain sight.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Fairy Fire \[pattern] \[mind-affecting]</mark>

You can create a display of colorful fire so beautiful it fascinates creatures. Sighted creatures within 30 feet of you become fascinated for up to 1 minute (will negates).

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Zap Arc</mark>&#x20;

You can cause your zap blast to jump to an additional target within 30 feet of the original, requiring a separate attack roll. If you charge the blast, you can target a third creature.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Firewall (3) \[concentration] \[persistent]</mark>

Create a barrier made out of fire. Creatures cannot see through the wall. You can make this barrier in different shapes. At least one section of the wall must be within reach.

Castle: 5 ft radius wall 10 ft high.\
Wall:    10 ft tall, 30 ft wide\
If you charge, you can increase the castle radius by 5 ft and its height by 10 ft. You can increase the wall's length by 30 ft and its height by 10 ft.&#x20;

Every time a creature moves through the barrier, they take your blast damage (reflex halves). Creatures 5 ft from the barrier take your level in damage each turn.

You take no damage from existing near your wall or passing through it.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Zap Arc (3)</mark>&#x20;

You can cause your zap blast to jump to an additional target within 30 feet of the original, requiring a separate attack roll. If you charge, you can target a third creature.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Burning Up</mark>&#x20;

Your fire elemental blast and elemental wave features set targets hit/fail their save ablaze.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Redirection (5)</mark>

When you or an ally within reach are targeted by an effect you can use your elemental counter feature against, you can use it as an immediate action. If you are successful, you can redirect it as though you had cast it, using your class DC. If you fail, you become the target (or center of the effect).

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Meteor (5) \[persistent] \[recharge]</mark>&#x20;

Launch an immense fire blast into the sky, the center of which lands on a space within 120 ft of you. Creatures within 5 ft of the impact zone have disadvantage on their save. Deal blast damage in a 40 ft radius and set all creatures ablaze (reflex halves damage and negates ablaze). The meteor's AoE sets creatures that walk through it ablaze (reflex negates).

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Roiling Magma (5) \[recharge] \[concentration] \[persistent]</mark>

You smash the ground violently, and magma pours from the impact, rapidly filling a 20 ft radius around you with magma rapidly. Creatures in the initial area of the spell take blast damage and have lava cling to them (reflex halves dmg and negates lava cling). Creatures that have lava cling to them have -15 speed and take 3d6 (10) fire damage each round at the end of their turns until 1 minute passes, or they are cooled through other means, such as getting wet or taking cold damage.

The AoE left behind is difficult terrain, and creatures that move through it have lava cling to them (reflex negates). You ignore all the negative effects of your roiling magma.
