## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Blast: Air</mark>

Your damage is crush. In order to use Su class abilities, some form of open air must be present within 30 ft range. This is usually only a problem in space or while submerged in liquid.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Movement: Hover</mark>

You can walk just above the ground giving you a hover speed. You can gently fall downwards to avoid fall damage as long as you can move. If you want to hover while it is not your turn, it has the \[concentration] tag.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Defense: Wind Stance</mark>

When you move at least 30 feet on your turn, attacks have 20% miss chance against you until the start of your next turn. Creatures that miss you with attacks as a result of this become clumsy 1.

I usually go "high roll leads to best result" for these types of features, so a 9 or 10 on a d10.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Intuition: Airbending \[concentration]</mark>

You can physically manipulate air within 30 ft. Unlike water and earth, air cannot create structures, nor can it lift enormous quantities of matter. You can manipulate unattended objects weighing up to (10\*lvl) lbs, moving them anywhere within range, including into your hands. Like with all bending, it rewards creativity and allows you to do anything gusts of wind could reasonably do, like allowing you to jump as high and far as you can move automatically or slowing the fall of creatures in a 10x10 area.

Initiating and maintaining concentration on air bending requires a standard action each turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">3 - Elemental Intuition: Gliding Technology</mark>

You've learned how to utilize gliding technology to allow you to fly. A glider requires 50g of wood and canvas and 8 hours to make. You gain a fly speed equal to your speed while using this glider. If the glider is sundered, you cannot use it to fly. Using a glider requires one hand.

## <mark style="color:green;">5 - Elemental Intuition: Airbending Adept</mark>

Jumping using airbending no longer requires concentration.

By spending a standard action to concentrate each turn, you can fly by creating a whirlwind underneath you, even without a glider. You are limited to flying 30 ft high like this. Each round you concentrate to fly like this you also remove all clumsy stacks.

You do not provoke AoOs by taking flight. When you fly you take no penalty to speed for flying up at a 45 degree or higher angle and can do so while clumsy. When flying you are capped at clumsy 2. If you take flight while clumsy 3 or higher, it decreases to clumsy 2.

## <mark style="color:green;">7 - Elemental Intuition: Winded Stance</mark>

When a creature gets clumsy as a result of wind stance, they also take 15 poise damage.

## <mark style="color:green;">9 - Elemental Intuition: High Ground</mark>

When you are flying at least 15 ft higher than a creature, you get +2 attack against them.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Elemental Intuition: Airbending Master</mark>

You can fly without the aid of gliding technology. You cannot be made clumsy while flying.
