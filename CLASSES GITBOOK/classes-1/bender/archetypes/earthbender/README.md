## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Blast: Earth</mark>

Your damage is crush. In order to use (Su) class abilities, you must be standing on the ground and some form of earth (rock, sand, dirt, even mud) must be present within 30 ft range.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Movement: Earth Glide</mark>

Burrow but it works in stone, lava (which still hurts you without resistance or adaptation) and more! . You move at a speed 10 if you leave a trail behind, or 5 if you don't.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Defense: Power Stance</mark>

Gain 5 poise. Reduce all poise damage by your level.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Intuition: Earthbending \[concentration]</mark>

You can physically manipulate earth within 30 ft. Bending as a whole allows for a great deal of creativity, but shouldnâ€™t affect objects of a size greater than one 5ft cube per level. Quickly moving rubble and creating stone bridges are some examples of things that you can do. Concentration with this ability requires a standard action each round. When you cease concentration, structures you made collapse and rocks you're lifting falls.

## <mark style="color:green;">3 - Elemental Intuition: Sense With Feet</mark>

You gain [blindsense (tremorsense 30ft)](https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/monster-qualities/other-traitss#blindsense). In general you are more sensitive to vibrations caused by things like earthquakes, stampedes, explosions and crumbling buildings, even if they aren't within 30 ft. This cannot function in water, even if you are amphibious.

## <mark style="color:green;">5 - Elemental Intuition: Earthbending Adept</mark>

You no longer need to concentrate in order to maintain the structures that you create with earthbending.\
You treat metal as earth for all class features.

## <mark style="color:green;">7 - Elemental Intuition: Countermeasures \[elusive]</mark>

When a creature fails to break your poise, you can bully them as an immediate action as long as they are within 30 ft.

## <mark style="color:green;">9 - Elemental Intuition: Sense With Feet</mark>

After 1 minute of concentration, you can stomp the ground to get a better view of things around you, and under you. You see the overall shape of structures and their interiors, as well as all creatures and objects of anything within 300 ft of the point of contact, so long as there is a continuous stream of earth.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Elemental Intuition: Earthbending Master</mark>

While blinded, your blindsense (tremorsense) improves to sightless blindsense. Its range increases to 120 ft.\
At the start of your turn as a free action, you can choose to blind yourself until the start of your next turn.
