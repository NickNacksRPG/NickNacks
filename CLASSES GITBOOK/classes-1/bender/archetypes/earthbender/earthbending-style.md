By spending a standard action each turn, you can cause it to follow your movement, or the movement of another creature of your choosing within 30 ft.

Cause a 30 ft long, 10 ft wide, 30 ft deep chasm to appear in a spot on the ground, the starting point needs to be within your natural reach. Creatures inside the AoE fall inside and take appropriate fall damage (reflex negates). A creature can opt to use athletics as an immediate action instead of their reflex save. A creature that's successfully saves can choose which side of the chasm they end up on.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Favored Terrain (3)</mark>&#x20;
