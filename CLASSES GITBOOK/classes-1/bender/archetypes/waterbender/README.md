## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Blast: Water</mark>

Your damage is crush. In order to use Su class abilities, a gallon of water (even ice) must be present within 30 ft range. Using less turns blast and other Su attacks into a FRA. Many waterbenders carry vessels like pouches for use away from oceans, rivers or glaciers.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Movement: Water Walking</mark>

Gain a swim speed of 30+(lvl\*5) ft. You can use this swim speed to surf across water's surface. You take no fall damage when falling into water if you can move.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Defense: Water Shield</mark>

You can take any of the [shield actions](https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/armor-and-shields). You can use all of the [shield special attacks](https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/weapon-rules/special-attacks#all-shields). You can use the buckler's parry feature. You only need water to perform these maneuvers.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Elemental Intuition: Waterbending \[concentration]</mark>

You can physically manipulate water (including ice) within 30 ft. Bending as a whole allows for a great deal of creativity, but shouldnâ€™t affect objects of a size greater than one 5ft cube per level. Redirecting water flow and creating temporary air bubbles to hide in water sources are some examples of things that you can do. Concentration with this ability requires a standard action each round. When you cease concentration, flow you redirect stops and water you are lifting falls.

You can also use all waterbending based abilities using water adjacent substances, such as fruit juice, blood or perfume. This does not include liquids of other substances, such as acids, poisons, mercury, lava etc.

## <mark style="color:green;">3 - Elemental Intuition: Freeze</mark>

You can use your elemental blast to deal cold damage or crush damage interchangeably. You can use water walking on ice. In general, you can use water, even moisture in the air, to decrease the temperature of things, such as to freeze metal to make it more brittle.

## <mark style="color:green;">5 - Elemental Intuition: Waterbending Adept</mark>

You no longer need to concentrate in order to maintain structures created by water bending.

You can carry large quantities of water with you using waterbending in order to fuel your abilities. Doing so for longer than 10 minutes without resting for 1 minute fatigues you.

## <mark style="color:green;">7 - Elemental Intuition: Water Limbs</mark>

Your natural reach increases during your turn by 5 ft this level and every level thereafter (max 30). You can retrieve and hold objects, including wielding weapons.

## <mark style="color:green;">9 - Elemental Intuition: Tundra Mastery</mark>

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Elemental Intuition: Waterbending Master</mark>

You can use water walking on land with a 5x5x5 cube of water, provided your water doesn't dry up.
