## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Versatile Blast</mark>

Your elemental blast can deal pierce, crush and slash damage interchangeably.

You can use elemental blast to perform combat maneuvers from a range. All combat maneuvers you do with your blast get a +4 bonus.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Riposte</mark>

You can also parry attacks aimed at allies within your blast range.\
When you successfully parry an attack, you can make an attack against the creature as an instant action, including using your blast. You can riposte against any attackers within 30 ft of you.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Soothing Waves (1) \[healing] \[recharge]</mark>

Using clean water, touch a creature to heal (blast damage) hp. This ability has a 1 minute cooldown.\
You can choose to give this the \[overheal] tag, but it also gains \[mana burn].

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Mist (1) \[concentration]</mark>

You permanently memorize the [Fog Cloud](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/clairvoyance/level-1/fog-cloud) technique. By spending a standard action each turn, you can cause it to follow your movement, or the movement of another creature of your choosing within 30 ft.

You can also spend a standard action to increase its size, essentially adding another fog cloud adjacent to the first one.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Drench (1)</mark>

As a swift action, give a creature the wet condition. If it is an enemy (reflex negates). This can effectively wash a creature clean for any features where that is relevant.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Plant Bending</mark>

You can move loose vegetation with your bending such as vines or other long flexible plants. This does not function against particularly dry plants like tumbleweed or dead plants. Against plant creatures, your blasts have a +2 bonus to attack or the DC as appropriate.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Bubble (1)</mark>&#x20;

As a standard action, you can bend water around the head of a creature within reach. A protective bubble forms around it, allowing it to breathe freely underwater for 1 hour.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Water-Ish Bending (1)</mark>&#x20;

You can use water bending to manipulate any liquids in the [alchemical items](https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/alchemical-items) section as though using the [catapult](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/alchemy/level-1/catapult) technique, but it deals your blast damage instead of its standard damage.

When you use the administer potion action, you can use waterbending to administer it as a swift action. This also makes it so it does not consume the targets immediate action.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Ice Slick (2) \[concentration] \[Persistent]</mark>

Completely freeze over a surface in slick ice. Freeze a 10 ft radius, centered on a point. Creatures inside of this radius are knocked down (reflex negates). Moving through an iced space knocks down creatures (reflex negates). You can avoid falling by treating icy spaces as difficult terrain.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Icy Hold (2)</mark>

Creature within 30 ft takes blast damage and is made frosty or entangled (reflex halves dmg and negates status). \
Athletics to escape entangle as a swift action. 1 fire damage frees the creature automatically.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Imbalanced</mark>

When you land your elemental blast, creatures are clumsy 1.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Push OR Pull</mark>&#x20;

Remove the mana cost of elemental wave.\
Creatures that fail their save against your elemental wave are pushed away from you or pulled towards you 10 ft (your choosing for all affected creatures).

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Water Pressure</mark>

Your water attacks are considered to be of [adamantine toughness](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/athletics/breaking-objects) for the purposes of destroying objects.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Ice Wall (3) \[concentration]</mark>

Create a barrier made out of ice with enough water. Creatures cannot see through the wall. You can make this barrier in different shapes. At least one section of the wall must be within reach.&#x20;

Igloo:   10 ft radius dome, complete with door.\
Castle: 5 ft radius wall 10 ft high.\
Wall:    10 ft tall, 30 ft wide.&#x20;

Creature can use athletics as a standard action to break through a 5x5 section of a wall (or more for larger creatures). Alternatively an attack that does 10 crush damage or 5 fire damage destroys a 5x5 section of the wall.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Favored Terrain (3)</mark>&#x20;

As a swift action, you can use waterbending to create icy terrain that lasts until the end of your turn, or until the end of your next turn. This can be used to make things like bridges, ramps, stairs or a small barrier to avoid an AoO.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Water Prison</mark>&#x20;

You permanently memorize [aqueous orb](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/goomshroom/level-3/aqueous-orb) without spending memory. If it originates from a body of water, your CL is increased by 2 and the orbs speed increases to 40 ft.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Cryofreeze (4)</mark>

You can freeze a defeated creature, giving them stasis permanently. Must take at least 30 fire damage to unfreeze. You can unfreeze them as an instant action if they are within 30 ft.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Whirlpool (4) \[concentration] \[persistent]</mark>

Choose a point on the surface of the water within 60 feet of you. Water within 30 ft rapidly starts to twist and turn toward that point, carrying anything within. Creatures within the area are immediately caught in the whirlpool (fort negates, putting them out of the AoE at nearest point). When the creature is caught, and every round thereafter, they take your blast damage (crush) and are pulled closer to the center in a very random fashion (roll dice to determine which side they end up on). After the second round of being caught, they are completely submerged underwater.

Each round a creature can attempt an athletics check as a FRA to escape the whirlpool's area.\
You are immune to the effects of your own whirlpool.\
All creatures in the area are made wet.

Special: If you use this outside of a body of water, its DC decreases by 2 and its radius decreases to 15 ft.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Icy Prison (4) \[recharge]</mark>

Entomb a creature in ice (reflex reduces effect to frosty). An attack that does 10 crush damage or 5 fire damage destroys the ice and frees the creature. An entombed creature can roll an athletics check as a standard action to escape.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Waters of Life (5) \[recharge] \[healing]</mark>

By spending 1000g to perform a special ritual, requiring 10 minutes of concentration, you can bless a small vial of water with incredible healing capabilities. You can use this blessed water to bring a creature back from the dead at 1 hp if it died within the last minute. You can innately tell when a creature is too far gone to heal with this.\
You can only have one vial of this blessed liquid at a time.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Octopus Stance (5) \[buff] \[recharge]</mark>&#x20;

As a standard action, enter octopus stance for 10 minutes, causing 8 tendrils of water to form around you. As an instant action, you can take a shield action or parry by sacrificing a tentacle.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Tsunami (5) \[recharge] \[concentration] \[persistent]</mark>

Cause an enormous and powerful wave of water to wash over the world. Form a wave 60 ft wide and 30 ft high that originates from your space and launch it in a direction. It moves 60 feet each round on your turn for 3 rounds before crashing. When the wave passes over a creature, it gets picked up by the wave (fort negates). When it gets picked up and every round after it takes blast damage and is entombed in the wave. A creature can attempt athletics with a -4 penalty as a FRA to escape, getting deposited somewhere near where they were trapped. If a creature is within the wave when it crashes, it takes 50% increased damage and is stunned for 1 round.

You can choose to ride the wave if you wish. The wave deals massive damage to structures and carries objects unless they are securely rooted in the ground. All creatures in the area are made wet.

Special: If the waves starting point is outside of a body of water, its DC decreases by 2, its height decreases to 15 and its width decreases to 30.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Blood Bending (5) \[concentration] \[recharge]</mark>&#x20;

Take control of the body of creature within 30 ft of you (assuming a significant portion of its body composition is made of water like humanoids), stunning it for 3 rounds (fort reduces to stagger for 3 rounds). As part of initially using the ability, and each round it is staggered/stunned by this ability as a swift action, you can cause the creature to attack its friends. If the creature is stunned, you can move it up to its speed and make simple attacks or take the charge action. If it is staggered, you can only force it to make a simple attack.
