# Zealot

Your unquestioning faith in your deity gives you unbridled strength and resilience in the face of danger. Your deity also gives you the authority to enforce their will through various supernatural powers, so long as you maintain a clean slate.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Martial)</mark>

You gain 1 technique points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on the protector tree.

Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Smite (Su) \[holy] \[recharge] \[curse]</mark>

The most powerful tool for defeating evil in the zealot's arsenal, smiting is meant to end a battle immediately and decisively. Spend 1 mana to target a creature within reach. They briefly feel the weight of their sins, as though they were creatures crawling on their back. The visual effect of smite varies depending on the zealot's patron deity, but they all involve some kind of divine intervention from the heavens above striking the foe. They take 10+(2\*lvl) holy damage (will halves). If they are at or below 50% hp, they take double damage. Sinful creatures with little to no chance for redemption, like undead or fiends, have disadvantage on their save.

If the creature survives the smite, you can choose to \[mana burn] to \[curse] them. While the curse persists, you do not recover this burned mana on rest. You automatically know the direction of the cursed creature at all times. The curse can only be removed by praying to the paladins patron deity and providing suitable penance for their actions, or by the zealot themselves.

Recharges after 1 minute.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Chivalry</mark>

You automatically gain proficiency in persuasion with a +4 bonus.

Whenever engaging with sentient creatures, aside from undead and fiends, you must first attempt to establish diplomatic relations, or otherwise resolve something peacefully (such as an arrest) before attacking them. If you personally have tried interacting with members of the same organization and failed to establish diplomatic relations previously, you need not attempt again. If you are attacked first, you may attack back.

If you do not try to resolve things peacefully first, you instigate fights, or you hang back and let your allies do the unchivalrous behavior in your stead while you are present, you gain a unique T3 affliction.

<mark style="color:green;">Shame</mark> - You are unable to smite or benefit from your chivalrous boons. A black marking of significance to your deity appears on your neck.

<mark style="color:green;">Cure</mark> - Return to a place of worship and repent for 7 consecutive days, involving religious ceremonies, communal activities, sermons, prayer etc.

You can generate an infinite number of copies of this weapon as long as the original is on your person. You pull these extra weapons out of your sleeve and pockets or materialize them out of thin air as a free action at any time. When you throw these copied weapons, drop them or embed them in your enemies, they persist for 1 minute before they disappear.

By spending 1 mana when you defeat a foe with a bonded weapon, you can leave it in the creature's body to prevent it from benefiting from \[healing] effects. Athletics as a swift action to remove.
