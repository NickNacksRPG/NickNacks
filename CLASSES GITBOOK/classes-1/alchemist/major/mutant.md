# Mutant

Your research is a bit self-centered. You were the only person who was willing to be a test subject for your research. Unfortunately it seems as though your research has developed a mind of its own, and in order to access its power, you need to share your body. In this particular example, your mutation enhances your physical prowess, but only when you let out this inner beast. This works very much like pointing a dog at an enemy, then unchaining them.

**As a free action, unleash the beast, gaining the following benefits**\
\>Athletics and acrobatics get a +4 bonus\
\>The _unarmed combatant_ feat with a basic multiattack of 2 attacks\
\>Grow to large size\
\>Increase speed by 10

**And the following drawbacks**\
\>Any turn you do not attack or destroy something during your turn, you take 3 true damage\
\>Disadvantage on saves vs taunt\
\>You can't do anything with the \[concentration] tag or cast spells. You cannot use wis, int, cha or dex based skills aside from perception, intimidation and acrobatics.\
\>After being out of combat for 1 minute, you must roll a will save against your class DC. If you fail, you attack the nearest creature.

To end your rampage, you must consume an item you craft with alchemical inspiration. If you run out, your rampage lasts until you are defeated or you rest.
