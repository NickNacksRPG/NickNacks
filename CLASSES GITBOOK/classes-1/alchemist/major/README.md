# Major

Making your own class features can be tough, both maintaining balance and a cohesive theme. This section should help provide guidelines for not only the types of things you should be thinking about studying for your alchemist, but also the power of the mechanical effects.

In general, majors can be separated into a few categories.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="142"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Enhancer</td><td>Primarily focused on adding attributes to creatures. Your creations are the next step in evolution or create entirely new types/fusions creatures.<br>Examples: Shao Tucker (FMA)</td></tr><tr><td>Transformer</td><td>Primarily focused on enhancing the self. These transformations come with great power, but also some kind of crippling flaw.<br>Examples: Dr. Jekyll n Mr. Hyde, The Hulk, Armor-Bonded Souls (FMA)</td></tr><tr><td>Manipulator</td><td>Primarily focused on manipulating physical matter in the world. You turn objects into other things or focus on a specific type of chemical reaction, like starting fires or causing explosions.<br>Examples: Most alchemists in FMA,</td></tr><tr><td>Friend Crafter</td><td><p>You made 1 specific very special creature. Itâ€™s a homunculus, or sentient ooze or something more exotic.</p><p>Examples: Flubber, Chaos (Sonic Adventure), Driders (DnD)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The main thing that you should be focusing on for your major is thinking about a completely unique thing that your character specializes in. It should be specific and limited in scope.

Idea Phase:\
"I specialize in transforming into animals" is a bit too vague and is too similar to the shapeshifter class. If we are on the cutting edge of new techniques, we want something that isn't just another class's features.

"I specialize in grafting beast parts to people" is more specific, and falls more closely in line with what you imagine a fantasy scientist would do. For me at least, it's easy to imagine Frankenstein's monster type alchemist that has slowly replaced his body with more optimal animal parts to become a completely unique creature.

Mechanics Phase:\
Sticking with the idea of grafting animal parts, this idea lends itself well to an enhancer type play style. You might gather the parts during your adventures by purchasing them or killing the beasts yourself, but gaining benefits requires work you do ahead of time.

Crafting rules are elsewhere, where you can find how long it takes, how much it cost and how difficult it should be. Right now we are concerned with the mechanics. What should a grafted part do? Considering you are fusing parts onto yourself you could give yourself noteworthy parts from other animals to gain permanent abilities: Dog nose for scent, bull horns for a natural attack, fins and gills for aquatic adventures. Considering you're replacing your humanoid parts, there might also be some drawbacks. Lion claws aren't the best for grasping things like opposable thumbs are, for example.

An ability like this can open up opportunities for limitless power as long as you keep pouring resources into it, so it should also have some hard limitation. Limiting yourself to only mixing and matching 3 parts for example. Considering the mechanical effect is similar, perhaps use shapeshifter's point system as a basis for how powerful the individual parts can be.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Thesis</mark>

Thesis marks the point where few have developed their research to this point. This should be the point where you start bending rules and creating increasingly ridiculous items with your craft.

Continuing with the idea of grafting animal parts, this is where you might add a second tier to your crafting. No longer are you just replacing parts, but you can add completely new ones, doing things like turning people into centaurs of all kinds of creatures, giving yourself an additional limb, maybe an extra beast head.

Up the limit of how many parts you can give a creature, so long as they are willing to accept tier 2 augmentations.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Grand Discovery</mark>

Grand discovery marks the point where only the best, brightest and most insane push their research to the boundaries of what should be possible. This is the point where you should be breaking rules and doing things once only thought imaginary.

By combining different animal parts from dead creatures, you can create entirely new creatures. You can make alterations to yourself to make you completely unrecognizable from when you began. Once upon a time you were a man. Now you are a massive spider from the waist down allowing you to climb any surface with ease, your torso is covered in thick chitin to protect your vitals, your head is covered in beady eyes to allow you to see in all directions.
