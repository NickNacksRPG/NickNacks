\>It's intelligence is -2 and it can speak a language of your choosing, but not very well\
\>It loses the evasion, scent, lost companions and one liner features of beast companion

<mark style="color:green;">Kaboom \[fire]</mark> - Using your standard action, or when it is defeated, your creation explodes violently. Deals (10+3\*lvl) fire damage in a 10 ft radius to ALL creatures (reflex halves).

\>You have evasion vs your creation's explosions (auto take half dmg, save for no effect).\
