## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Fungus Amungus</mark>

Infect willing, sleeping or defeated creatures with parasitic spores as a standard action. You can also inflict this upon a creature you have skin to skin contact with as a standard action. This infection deals no damage and has no noticeable side effects or visual symptoms at all.

While a creature is infected, you get a +2 bonus on skill checks made against it. You also know the direction they are from you. You can infect up to 5 people at once. Infecting more forces you to decide to free another. You can remove an infection as a free action.

This infection can be identified and removed with a medicine check (DC=class DC).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Power Up (Su)</mark>

You don't just grow mushrooms, you become the mushroom. Every day you can grow 3 mushrooms on your body that contain magic within them that is unleashed when plucked and eaten. The magic is chosen when they are plucked. Plucking and eating/feeding is a single swift action. You can choose to grow new mushrooms with new powers on the following days, but growing new ones drains the magic from the old ones.\
Mushrooms can be preemptively plucked and handed out to allies so they don’t need to be next to you to consume.

In addition to spreading your infection, the mushrooms can have the following effects…

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="197"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mega Mush [buff]</td><td>Grow to huge size (1 minute)</td></tr><tr><td>Mini Mush [buff]</td><td>Shrink to tiny size (1 hour)</td></tr><tr><td>Metal Mush [buff]</td><td>Gain DRA 2 and resistance to poise damage. Decrease speed by 15. -10 to stealth. (1 minute)</td></tr><tr><td>Rainbow Mush [mind affecting]</td><td>Creature is fascinated for 1 hour. When interrupted during this hour, they naturally return to being fascinated after 1 minute.</td></tr><tr><td>Double Mush [figment]</td><td>An illusory copy of you appears adjacent. You can give it a simple task and it does it to the best of its ability. It cannot interact with physical objects. Lasts 1 hour or until harmed.</td></tr><tr><td>Royal Mush [glamer]</td><td>Transforms creature into princess version of itself, giving it an air of nobility. Any situation that could benefit from being of a privileged class grants you advantage on skill checks, such as getting into an exclusive party, seeing real royalty etc. Lasts until rest.</td></tr><tr><td>Return to Fungus [poly, true] [dismissable]</td><td>You transform into inanimate fungus. You can transform into a very large stalk, or as many smaller fungi grouped together as appropriate. You maintain you senses, but can take no actions or move other than to revert to your original form. Lasts until rest or until harmed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Mush Touch (Su)</mark>

By touching a surface, you can cause a tiny toadstool to sprout at that location. In less than ideal environments, they quickly perish. You can choose to leave behind a trail of these tiny toadstools behind when you while you walk.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Resonant Spores</mark>

You can telepathically communicate to any creatures infected by your spores.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Puffed Up (Su)</mark>

1/minute when you fall below half hp, you release a cloud of toxic gas within a 10 ft radius. While within the gas, creatures not infected by your spores are sickened 1 and have blurred vision. These effects persist for 1 round after leaving the cloud.

## <mark style="color:green;">3 - Shiny \[Light]</mark>

As a swift action, you can cause your creations to glow with bio luminescence. Any creatures you have infected with spores as well as any mushrooms you create with Power Up or Mush Touch glow with a bright light in a 5ft radius.

This isn't particularly useful in bright places, but in darkness it can light the way.\
Glowing creatures take a -5 penalty to stealth and cannot use darkness to hide.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Decomposition (Su) \[Recharge]</mark>

You can cause dead or decaying organic matter to be overtaken by fungus and accelerate the decomposition process. This can be used to target things like corpses, fallen trees and leaves, or even wooden doors. This typically has the effect of damaging the structural integrity of the object. For something like a small wooden barrier, it only takes a few rounds. For something much larger like a wall or an enormous fallen tree, it can take minutes.

This provides sustenance to you, and this limits its usability. Decomposing something about your size like a door is more like a snack, but a particularly large object like an ornate wooden staircase is like eating a feast all on your own. You may need to wait until you are hungry again to fully decompose such objects.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Mush Men (Su) \[mana burn] \[scrying]</mark>

By spending 1 mana, you can animate a tiny mushroom to have little legs and eyes. They perish if attacked, have a speed of 30 and use your perception/stealth scores. You can give them telepathic orders, but they can do little more than keep watch or wander in general directions. They will mentally alert you (waking you up) if you they see something unusual, like an intruder, or something dangerous/scary. You can teach them a specific creature if you wanted them to find someone or something in specific.

If they touch a creature, they can transfer your infection. This is usually only possible against incapacitated, friendly or willing creatures. Against an unwilling creature, you must succeed on a melee attack against a DD creature (uses your attack bonus).

You can scry through the mushmen. You cannot recover the mana as long as the mushman persists, even if you rest. If the mushman returns to you safely, you recover the mana burn. If it dies, you must rest to restore it. You can willingly dismiss a mu

## <mark style="color:green;">5 - Absorb</mark>

When you get the wet condition, you increase 1 size category instead. Further applications of wet apply normally. You shrink back to normal size after you rest or with exposure to direct sunlight for a few minutes.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Power Up+ (Su) \[poison]</mark>

You can create an additional Power Up each day. Gain additional options.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="158"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Magic Mushroom</td><td>You can temporarily abate the negative effects of a T1 affliction for 1 hour.</td></tr><tr><td>Higher Plane</td><td>Creature gains the time out condition until rest.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Green Demon (Su) \[poison] \[recharge]</mark>

Target a creature more than 30 feet away from. A dangerous and toxic mushroom pops out of your hand and relentlessly follows them for 1 minute. It flies at a speed of 30 at the end of each of your turns, moving in a direct line towards its target. This can lead to the mushroom getting "caught" on solid terrain.

If it ever enters the space of the target creature, or if another enemy enters its space, it is immediately infected. The creature then takes d6/lvl poison damage (fort halves) and is dazed for 1 round.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - 1-Up (Su) \[healing] \[recharge]</mark>

Make a mushroom that you can feed to a creature that has died in the last minute to restore them to 1 hp. Usable 1/month.
