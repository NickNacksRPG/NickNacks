# Beast Whisperer

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Band of Beasts \[recharge]</mark>

Most druids have a way with animals, but you are truly their maestro. When you succeed on a wild empathy check against a beast, you can communicate a complex set of instructions that are unusual, even uncomfortable, but not physically impossible for the creature. This can include things like a cat or dog walking on 2 legs for a short period, a rat making an unusually large amount of noise squeaking or a fish jumping out of water to do a barrel roll.&#x20;

This beast can also serve as an emissary to its kind in the surrounding area. If you are willing to wait 10 minutes (and the beast in question has a substantial local population), this singular beast can multiply into dozens, or potentially hundreds to perform incredibly unusual activities. A bunch of local cats marching in the streets to your marching orders, a band of differently sized rats squeaking a simple jingle you orchestrate or an entire school of fish moving to make shapes of your choosing as you speak (ex finding nemo).

You can only call a group of beasts in this way 1/week.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Phone a Friend</mark>

You can always find a general category of beast (something smart, a swimmer, something rideable, beast of burden, a reptile etc) by spending 5 minutes to look around your environment, provided there is one that exists.

If you \[mana burn], you can will a general category of beast to come to you immediately, even if it isn't native to this environment, so long as it wouldn't quickly die existing where you are.

You can never call upon a specific type of creature when you use this feature. Generally speaking, weaker creatures and herbivores are the first to respond.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Petting Technique</mark>

You get advantage on wild empathy checks when used against beasts/magical beasts.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Copycat \[poly, true]</mark>

As a swift action, you can copy any animal you can see within 30 ft. This transformation gives no boons, merely changes your size/appearance. You can speak normally while in animal form. This transformation lasts indefinitely, but can be ended as a swift action.

While transformed you have advantage on disguise checks to go unnoticed if the animal could reasonably be there (dogs in urban areas, birds perched on trees, but not horses in an inn or a dinosaur in the arctic).

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Nature Strikes \[recharge]</mark>

You can call beasts and magical beasts to your side to aid you in battle.

The type of help they provide is something they must be able to do naturally. The entire effect must happen within 60 ft of you and the AoE is a 20 ft radius or a 60 ft line. Each effect that deals damage always does (3d6+CL) damage.

The effects are not limited to, but should be no more powerful than…

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="130"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Stampede</td><td>A large quantity of beasts rush through the area, plowing through anyone in their path.<br>Crush damage, applies clumsy 2 (reflex halves).</td></tr><tr><td>Bombard</td><td>Beasts positioned above the battlefield toss trash, spit, or deposit their leavings on some unfortunate soul.<br>Poison damage, applies sickened 2 (fort halves)</td></tr><tr><td>Howl</td><td>Beasts starting hooting and hollering, making as much noise as possible to disorient.<br>Sonic damage, applies shaken 2 (will halves)</td></tr></tbody></table>

This ability has a 1 minute cooldown.

## <mark style="color:green;">3 - Beast Companion \[companion]</mark>

You gain the service of a specific animal to aid you on your journey. It grows more powerful as you do. More rules on beast companions in the beast companion section of beast trainer.

Its level is 1/3 your level.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Get Shit On \[Recharge]</mark>

1/day you can force a serendipity check, so long as the result includes animals as a major component. You must decide what you want to happen first, then your DM tells you its DC. Negotiate a simpler task if you think the DC is too high.

Some examples of what you can accomplish…

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="89"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td>Get a group of animals to agree with you by making some kind of vocalization</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Get a bird to poop on someone while outdoors</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>A vendor that sells pets renders in town</td></tr></tbody></table>

If you fail the check then nothing happens, potentially making you look like an idiot depending on the setup.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Lolcat</mark>

Gain a new option with Nature Strikes

You summon a cat/kitten to a spot you can see within 100 ft. The cat immediately starts doing something silly or adorable, like eating a cheeseburger or existing with a silly outfit. Creatures within 30ft of this cat are fascinated for 1 minute (will negates). Creatures that are minions to you get no save.

Creature doesn't need to be a cat. Can easily be some other silly animal. Cats just have a high concentration of silly.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - King of Beasts</mark>

You get an honorary crown, befitting of a king of beasts.

All beasts treat you with the reverence usually only afforded to royalty by their subjects and servants. Unless a beast is under direct control from another creature, or a higher level than you, it will not harm you or otherwise impair you. Nature Strike can be used every other round and commanding large groups of beasts using Band of Beasts can be performed every day.

If you stay in the same roundabout area, such as a forest or a valley, all your beast subjects will come to you when your kingdom comes under siege. This could mean the destruction of habitat, hunting on a large scale or particularly ominous creatures moving in. They can give you detailed descriptions about unnatural phenomenon or strange creatures as well as their general location.
