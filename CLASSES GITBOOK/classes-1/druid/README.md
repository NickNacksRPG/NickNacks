# üåç Druid

Druids focus on the supernatural side of nature: with the ability to commune with it as though it were a person. They choose a specific aspect of nature to focus on, such as plants or animals. The abilities granted to them by Mother Earth allow them to interact and manipulate these things to a sometimes comical degree.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Magical)</mark>

You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another 2 points every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on the Mother Earth, Lunar or Shroomlette tree.

Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Druidic</mark>

You learn the secret language, druidic. In text form it can only be seen by other creatures that know druidic. You can essentially write secret messages by touching your finger to any natural object (typically boulders and trees) and writing. Any message written in this way can be erased by a creature that knows druidic with ease.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Nature Tongue</mark>

You can speak with animate plants, beasts and magical beasts as though you share a common language. They are able to much better articulate their feelings as though they possessed the intellect of a simple humanoid, but their instincts, desires and attitude toward you remain largely the same.

&#x20;You can also interact with inanimate plants, but these creatures only have the most basic of ideas, only able to give single word answers like yes/no or a direction.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Nature Stride</mark>

When traveling through natural terrain that restricts your movement, such as thick snow or dense jungle, your speed is not affected. All allies that can see you also gain this benefit. After not seeing you for a few minutes, your allies lose this benefit.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Wild Empathy</mark>

Gain the wild empathy feat. Its usable on any creatures you can speak to with nature tongue, allowing you to influence plants.

You need not roll against inanimate plants, but their influence is incredibly limited, only able to help by shaping their growth for instance. If multiple druids try to influence the same plant, they roll to establish dominance permanently.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Skill</mark>

You automatically get knowledge nature as a skill with a +4 bonus.
