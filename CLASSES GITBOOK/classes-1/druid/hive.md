# üêù Hive

Your body has transformed to be a suitable home for a specific type of insect. Your symbiosis with this hive gives you the ability to command them. You protect them, they protect you.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Hive Mind</mark>

+2 vs any effect with the \[mind affecting] tag.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Territory</mark>

Mark a location as your territory by allowing your hive to build structures there over the course of a few days. This location is a 100ft radius, centered on a point. Your territory gives the following benefits

\>You have regeneration 1 in your territory\
\>You have +4 perception in your territory\
\>You have +1 priority in your territory\
\>Your hive watches over the area constantly, using your perception. If they detect something, you know what they see as though you had seen it yourself, even if you are not there (Su).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Hive Body</mark>

Parts of your body are constantly shifting and moving, making it difficult to pinpoint where your weak points are. You have the amorphous quality, which means to crit you, the enemy needs to roll your AC+12.

You can command your hive to attack any creature within your natural reach as a standard action, automatically dealing (2d6+CL) pierce damage.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Hive Consumption \[poly, true]</mark>

Become the hive. As a standard action, turn the entirety of your body/gear into a large swarm, gaining the following features.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="175"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AoE Vulnerability</td><td>Take 50% more damage from any AoE effect</td></tr><tr><td>Single Target Resistance</td><td><p>Resistance to any damage that only affects a single creature, most common with attack rolls. Certain attacks like cleave can ignore this resistance.</p><p>Single target effects that deal no damage have no effect.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Poise Resistance</td><td>Cannot be poise broken</td></tr><tr><td>Swarm attack</td><td>Does not threaten. These creatures cannot make attacks and must instead enter a creatures space to deal their damage automatically at the end of their turn. This allows them to damage multiple creatures if they are close together with a big enough swarm.<br>Doesn't affect allies.</td></tr><tr><td>Fly</td><td>40</td></tr></tbody></table>

You can speak but you are unable to wield a staff in hive form, making you unable to cast spells.\
You can revert back to your original form as a standard action.

You can also choose to host groundborne insects, such as ants. You lose the fly speed and gain a land and climb speed of 40. Your swarm attack damage increases to 3d6.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Eye of the Swarm</mark>

Any hive of insects under your control also protects your allies. While within the swarm, you allies are treated as though they have cover (+2 ac and reflex).

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Bug Bite</mark>

When you attack with hive body, you can attack all creatures within your natural reach.\
Your hive attack applies sickened 1.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Expanded Territory</mark>

The size of your territory expands to a 1000 ft radius.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Distraction</mark>

Your hive attack staggers for 1 round (fort negates).

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Hive Separation \[companion]</mark>

You can lose your hive mind and hive body features and have your hive separate from your body as a standard action. Treat it as an insect swarm (lvl 4 beast). It cannot be more than 100 ft away from you, or else it immediately returns. If it is ever defeated, it returns to you and this ability is disabled until you rest. While reunited with you, your swarm has regen 1.

If you share a space with your swarm, you can choose to absorb it as an instant action.\
Your hive is always half your level.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Home Defense</mark>

You always have a bonus hive defending your territory, functioning exactly as hive separation, but it cannot leave your territory.\
Your territory increases to a 1 mile radius.
