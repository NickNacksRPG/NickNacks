# Explorer

Explorers are the generalist healers with a handful of utility abilities that assist with travel. They promote treating creatures with mercy whenever possible, and in the most extreme examples, can make death impossible. Their aura is powerful enough that existing near them makes you safer.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Aura of Mercy (Su)</mark>

Gain a 10ft aura in which creatures cannot gain stacks of Doom. Enemies also do not die when defeated in this aura. This aura is suppressed when you are defeated, or activated/deactivated as a free action on your turn.

This aura has a distinct, personalized visual component that interferes with stealth.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Lucky Break</mark>

You add your luck as a bonus to all healing effects.

You can add luck to a roll an ally makes as an immediate action if they are within your aura of mercy. You still cannot add luck twice (ie you both add luck to the roll).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Compassion (Su) \[mind affecting]</mark>

When you use Channel Energy, enemies in range that were aggressors/not acting in self-defense are pacified for 5 rounds (will negates). They get a new save at the end of their turns if you or your allies take aggressive actions versus their allies, and it ends immediately if you or your allies take aggressive actions towards them.

If there are no enemies left, initiative ends, and this ability can be extended for up to 10 minutes as long as you try resolving the conflict peacefully.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Cure (Su) \[healing]</mark>

When you use healing touch, creatures get a new save against any lingering effects that would normally give additional saves (such as poison and some fear effects). Does not apply to permanent status like curses or drain.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Endure Elements (Su)</mark>

Creatures that touch your aura of mercy receive a blessing for 1 hour. This blessing allows them to exist inside of otherwise hazardous environments without harm. Blessed creatures ignore environmental effects like toxic volcanic gas, thin air at extreme heights, extremes in temperature, the vacuum of space or the pressure/lack of air in underwater environments.

This does not make you immune to hazardous weather, such as hail, windstorms, lightning, quicksand etc. Only passive effects that prevent you from existing.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Mystic Door (Su) \[teleportation]</mark>

When you rest in a settlement of at least 100 people, you can mark one of the doorways, portals, or similar entrance in the place you rested as your Mystic Doorstep.

Until you rest again, as long as you are within 10 miles of the place you slept, you can conjure a Mystic Door that links to the Mystic Doorstep for one minute. It is the same size as the entry you marked.

It takes one minute to cast. Any creature can take the portal back simply by walking through it, but it is one-way. Once the Mystic Door disappears, so does your Mystic Doorstep.

This effect does not require line of sight.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Dispel (Su) \[recharge]</mark>

As a standard action, touch a creature. On an ally, one harmful spell or supernatural effect immediately ends, unless it is permanent. On an enemy, this functions as Dispel Magic. For cursed items, this allows the safe removal of the item, but requires a caster level check.

This has a 10 minute unique cooldown.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Blessing of Restoration (Su) \[healing]</mark>

You recover from all stacks of drain every time you rest, regardless of conditions.

As a standard action, you can touch a creature to absorb 1 stack of drain from them and you become drained 1. A creature can only be affected by this once each week.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Elemental Protection (Su)</mark>

Gain resistance to a non-physical damage type. Allies in your aura also gain this.

You can change what you're resistant to by spending 10 minutes adjusting your magic.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Angel Ray (Su)</mark>

Your Holy Arrow has its range increased by 10.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Benediction (Su)</mark>

Creatures you heal with channel energy benefit from dispel (ignoring the cooldown), and can make a simple attack as an instant action.
