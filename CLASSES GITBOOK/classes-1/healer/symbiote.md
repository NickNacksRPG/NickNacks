# Symbiote

You body is filled with foreign microscopic organisms that have taken a liking to their new home, and do their best to keep their host alive. You have developed a unique codependency with these creatures which manifests in strange organic growths on your body that give you a host of alien powers.

Symbiote trades consistent healing with burst healing and higher disruption.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Enhanced Arm</mark>

One of your arms comes with extra attachments, often including enhanced musculature, tentacles, claws and such. This hand cannot wield equipment like staves, weapons, shields etc.

You gain a natural attack that does 2d6 damage (crush, pierce or slash, chosen on character creation). You get a +2 bonus when using this attack, increased to +8 when using combat maneuvers.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Infection</mark>

When you use your enhanced arm attack, infect enemies for 3 turns on hit or when you successfully poise break them. Infected enemies have any FH disabled. Also disables regeneration if it can be removed by a specific damage type (like fire).

You have +2 to attack with your enhanced arm against infected creatures.\
Infection is removed automatically by any \[healing] effect or by administering first aid.\
Allies you use healing touch on also get infected. Channel energy applies infection to all enemies and allies.

Enemies can remove this infection with a medicine check as a standard action (DC=your DC).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Patient Zero</mark>

You have FH (1+â…“ lvl). By using healing touch, or touching an ally within reach as a free action, you can infect them to give them this FH for 10 minutes.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Rapid Growth \[healing] \[necrotic] \[recharge]</mark>

If a creature has gotten a share of your infection, you can spend a swift action to apply healing touch to all infected creatures. Allies regain hp and enemies take the same amount as necrotic damage and are staggered for 1 round (fort negates stagger).

This ability removes the infection.

Cannot be used in consecutive rounds.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Organic Length</mark>

Your reach with your enhanced arm increases by 5 ft during your turn. This reach increases by another 5 ft every even level (@4 +10 reach, @12 +30 reach).

Size does not affect your reach with this limb.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Swipe</mark>

By spending 2 mana, you can target a (reach) ft cone. Creatures within take your arm damage, are infected and are knocked back to the end of the cone (reflex negates).

Ex. At this level it is a 15 ft cone. @12 it is a 35 ft cone.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Massive Shove</mark>

Whenever you shove a creature, it is pushed to the edge of your reach in a straight line, then an additional 10 ft. Creatures impacting terrain are staggered for 1 round (fort negates).

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Siphon \[persistent] \[concentration]</mark>

Spend 3 mana to dig your enhanced arm into the ground and have it emerge in a space within reach. A 10 ft radius around this point is consumed by your organic growth, turning it into difficult terrain, even to hovering creatures. Enemies that start their turn within this area or move into it take your enhanced arm damage.

Enemies within the area are siphoned until they leave.

You can choose to maintain this ability indefinitely at no additional cost. If you are moved from your position or poise broken, this effect ends.

This effect must be used through a solid surface. You need line of sight, but do not need line of effect.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Congo Line</mark>

Whenever you shove a creature, all creatures in a line behind them are shoved as well (reflex negates).

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Terminal</mark>

Enemies are infected until the effect is removed manually.\
Rapid growth doesn't end infections.
