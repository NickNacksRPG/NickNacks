# üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß Mom

Moms exist to support their team outside of battle just as much as they do inside the battle.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Emotional Support \[healing]</mark>

Mom can remove any tier 1 affliction with 1 hour of coddling.&#x20;

You gain a unique T1 affliction (see [afflictions](https://app.gitbook.com/s/EuW2xQOuMIcaalg1YNV3/afflictions) for more details). Other moms cannot remove this affliction with emotional support.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Hug (Su)</mark>

When you initiate a grapple on an enemy, they are pacified for 1 round instead of the usual effects.

By spending 1 mana as a standard action, you can grapple an ally to put them in stasis for 1 round and remove all shaken stacks.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 -Good Boy Points</mark>

Mom says she doesn't play favorites, but we all know that‚Äôs a lie. Everybody must fight for Mom's favor. Mom keeps track of all the good things her children (everybody) do. This functions like God Benediction Points (see gods) with 3 tiers of favor. More details in the GBP section.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Call Me</mark>

T1 good boys can innately use the upcast version of [sending](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/larella/level-1/sending) 1/day, but only to contact mom.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Professional Mom</mark>

You get a unique profession proficiency called Mom with a +4 bonus. You can use to to perform any type of mom-y activities, such as daycare services for children. Tangential/stereotypical features of momming, such as cooking, cleaning and other such things can use this skill, but do not receive the +4 bonus.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Lost and Found \[recharge]</mark>

Mom has a 6th sense for objects of significance, and often randomly picks them up for safekeeping. You can procure a specific item a creature once owned that someone mentions they misplaced, so long as you have been to a location it could be reasonably located.\
Ex. "Oh you guys went into Old Man's Cave? I remember going there once. Lost my wedding ring there."\
"This wouldn't happen to be it would it?"

You can't use it to proactively search for something, like a secret entrance, or a sacred artifact, unless an ancient resurrected hero is missing their sword and it was last seen in a place you‚Äôve been (and it wasn't closely guarded). This doesn't let you retrieve items that are in someone else's possession and the DM can choose to deny particularly unlikely circumstances.

Recharges every Monday.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Mommy Energy</mark>

You exude a palpable aura of love. Creature's find it difficult to harm you. Creatures who attempt to harm you must redirect their aggression for the remainder of their turn (will negates). This does not consume the action, but it does force them to alter it, such as attacking another creature, or excluding you from an AoE.

Once a creature passes their save, or you deal damage, mom is on the menu and this aura is gone.
