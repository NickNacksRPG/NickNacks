# Beast Trainer Actions

All listed abilities are special attacks, and can only be performed once per combat (each). I split them up based on which type of specialized training it fits better, but its not a hard requirement. Number next to ability is level requirement.\
The bonus effect only occurs if both you and your best companion hit and happens in addition to any of the other effects.
