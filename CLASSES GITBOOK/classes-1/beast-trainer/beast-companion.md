Your animal companion understands one language of your choosing (usually common).  Its size is small or medium.

For ease of play reasons, it is assumed that your beast companion generally does as you wish and you are allowed to control all of its actions in combat, though it does still have a will of its own.

All companions have the following set of ability scores and armor, chosen on character creation. Add dexterity to this armor value.
