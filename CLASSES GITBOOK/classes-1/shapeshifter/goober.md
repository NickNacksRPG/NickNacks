## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Shapeshift</mark>

Add the goober qualities to the list you can use this feature.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Shapeshift</mark>

Your base form permanently changes to that of a pool of semisolid ooze similar weight and volume to your original body. You count as your previous creature type(s) and ooze. While in ooze form, all of the items on your person float around in your jelly body. You cannot make attacks, cast spells, use items (including armor, weapons and shields) unless they are very simple like a doorknob or a button. As a semisolid, you can slide through and hide in thin crevices.\
\
Other than the qualities mentioned above, you otherwise function as normal. Moving at the same speed, being able to carry the same amount, being able to speak, having the same senses etc.

As a swift action, you can abandon your amorphous qualities in order to assume the roundabout humanoid shape that you used to have, albeit with a much more gooey aesthetic. Whenever you shapeshift into other creatures, you maintain this gooey aesthetic.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Wild Empathy</mark>

Only functions against ooze creatures.

## <mark style="color:green;">3 - Mitosis \[companion]</mark>

As a standard action, you can sacrifice half of your current and max hp to split into two copies of yourself. It functions exactly as you, expending your resources such as mana, limited uses per day items and abilities, consumable items etc.

TLDR; This ability does not generate more resources.

Your copy is a minion version of you (making it 1/3 your level). It is 1 size category smaller than you and uses the hp you sacrificed as its max hp. If you are ever defeated, the copy turns into an inert pile of goo. If the mini you perishes, you regain your max hp.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Amorphous</mark>

The number to crit you is AC+13

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Stretching Strikes</mark>

Take no MA penalties this turn. Your reach increases to 30 ft for this attack. If you land this attack and another attack against a different creature without moving more than 30 ft away from the original target, you can pull these creatures towards each other, meeting at a midpoint between them. They take an 4d6 (14) crush damage. Both creatures are dazed for 1 round (fort negates daze).
