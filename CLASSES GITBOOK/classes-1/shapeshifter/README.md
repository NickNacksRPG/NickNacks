# Shapeshifter

Unleash the power of the wilds. Shapeshifters are incredibly versatile, capable of adapting to any situation on a dime with their shapeshifting ability, though they typically focus on tearing their enemies to shreds with their claws.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Martial)</mark>

You gain 1 technique points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on the beastmode tree.

Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Shapeshift (Su) \[poly, true or chimeric]</mark>

You have (3+lvl) shapeshift charges. As a swift action, consume one to gain a series of ANY benefits from the polymorph list. Each of these qualities has a point value associated with them. You have (3+lvl) points to choose abilities with. These points are often used through other features and are referred to as <mark style="color:red;">adaptation points.</mark>

The effects last an hour and are permanent @6.  All benefits are replaced the next time you use it.

While under the effects of a \[poly, baleful] effect, you can use shapeshift to immediately end it and still benefit from shapeshift as normal.

See subsection for all abilities. You have access to all the charts, unless it shares the name with an archetype.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Shifter Claws</mark>

You possess claws on your hands that you can sheathe and unsheathe. This natural attack deals 2d6  slashing damage while your hands are empty, or d10 if they are not. Typically while shapeshifted (using the true polymorph version) you can't wield weapons, shields etc so the damage is always 2d6. Any other natural attacks that you gain through this class shares this damage, but often with a different damage type. These claws persist through shapeshift, transforming into another form of attack if the creature doesn't have a similar pair of limbs to adapt to (rhino, lion).

Your claws share the properties of a single weapon in your position, such as magic enchantment, a magic focuses ability to cast spells, or special attacks. You can bond to a new weapon with a 1 minute ritual requiring concentration and contact with the weapon.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Multiattack</mark>

Make two attacks, one of which must be with your shifter claws.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Feat</mark>

Gain the wild empathy feat.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Druidic</mark>

Aside from being a secret language, druidic can only be read by other creatures that know druidic. You can essentially write secret messages by touching your finger to any natural object (typically boulders and trees) and writing. Any message written in this way can be erased by a creature that knows druidic with ease.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Beast Speech (Su)</mark>

You can speak with beasts as though you shared a common language. They are able to much better articulate their feelings as though they possessed the intellect of a simple humanoid, but their instincts, desires and attitude toward you remain largely the same.

## <mark style="color:green;">3 - Beast Companion</mark>

You gain the service of a specific animal to aid you on your journey. It grows more powerful as you do. More rules on beast companions in the beast companion section of beast trainer.

Its level is 1/3 your level.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Uncanny Dodge</mark>

You cannot be DD unless feinted, stunned, or otherwise completely prevented from taking actions.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Animal Instinct</mark>

You can spend a shapeshift charge to get an overall hunch of a creature or terrain by picking up on things others might miss, like sudden changes in the wind, the absence of animal sounds or subtle scents.

When used against a creature, you learn whether the creature is interested in taking advantage of you, interested in helping you, or not particularly interested in you. You don't learn about their plans, only their relation to you. If the creature is a beast, you also learn if it is polymorphed.

When you use it on a terrain, its mostly focused on your immediate vicinity or a place you plan to go, such as a cave mouth or the front gate of a town. You learn if the place is dangerous, a safe haven, or neutral. You don't learn why it's dangerous, you just get a bad feeling. If the terrain is natural, you automatically see through any illusions in your direct line of sight.

{% hint style="info" %}
**That 'aint natural!**\
Something is "natural" when it is on the mortal plan and it isn't made by sentient creatures. Things like towns and dungeons usually aren't natural.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Wild Heart \[healing]</mark>

When you use shapeshift, you gain 5 temp hp. This increases to 10 temp hp if you use it to true polymorph into a creature.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Fluid Form</mark>

Your form is fluid and ever changing. You no longer have a true form, and everything you transform into is considered your new "true form." This makes it so creatures cannot forcefully end your polymorph effects with things like [dispel magic](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/wildcard/level-2/dispel-magic) or [true form](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/brazzeria/level-2/true-form).

You no longer spend charges when using shapeshift as a swift action. You can spend 1 charge to shapeshift as a free action. You can still only shapeshift once a turn.&#x20;
