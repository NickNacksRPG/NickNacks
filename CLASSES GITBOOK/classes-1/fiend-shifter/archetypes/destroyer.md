# Destroyer

Destroyer shifters are the most monstrous of all fiend shifters. They specialize in destruction, feats of strength and striking fear in the hearts of their enemies. Destroyer abilities are inspired by fiendish, animalistic and monstrous creatures with little more than the desire to kill.

&#x20;Your specialization is martial. Your technique trees are **Barbarism** and **Cataclysm.**

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - First Seal: Fiendish Frenzy (Su)</mark>

When you break the first seal, you increase to large size and increase your speed by 10. If there isn't enough room for you to grow, you can roll athletics as an instant action to make room. When you transform you can willingly choose to give yourself the taunted condition against one enemy that you can see. You can also choose to immediately take the focus action against them. You get +4 to d20s (attack, skills, saves etc) against enemies that taunt you. You can choose to automatically fail any effects that taunt.

Whenever you use this self-inflicted taunt and you do not attack or otherwise attempt to cause harm to the creature that you are taunted by, you take 3 psychic damage and the taunt ends.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Second Seal: Bloodlust (Su)</mark>

When you break the second seal, you increase to huge size. As part of the action to break the seal, and every turn after as a swift action, you can dash, as long as you are taunted. If the creature you are taunted by is defeated, leaves combat, is devoured, or you otherwise aren't taunted, you can choose to be taunted by another creature as an instant action.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Final Seal: Monstrosity (Su) \[fear]</mark>

When you break the final seal, you increase up to massive size. Any creature you are taunted by must make a will save or be frightened for as long as you are taunted by them (will negates).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Cacophonous Clap \[sonic]</mark>

You gain the rend monster ability (2 claws). Deals 2d6 (7) sonic damage.

As a standard action, or at the end of a charge, deal 2d8+lvl (9+lvl) sonic damage to all creatures within your natural reach and stagger all creatures hit for one round (fort halves damage and negates stagger).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Tongue</mark>

Gain a special attack\
<mark style="color:green;">Grasping Tongue (Special Attack)</mark> - Kidnap your foe. If the attack lands, make an additional drag attack.

You gain an extra long and dexterous tongue capable of grasping and finely manipulating objects as well as your hands. You can also use it to make attacks with +10 reach during your turn (deals crush damage).

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Taste Test (Su)</mark>

Whenever you land a tongue attack, or just lick someone, you learn a tidbit of information about the creature. This information is one of the few things: A random piece of personal information (such as a love interest), something that weighs heavy on the creature's mind (such as upcoming important events) or the creature itself (as per one section of monster lore). If you've already learned about the creature through monster lore (even from an ally or previously licking the creature) you can instead learn about another category.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Destructive Tendencies</mark>

Your claws are considered to be of adamantine toughness. You get a +4 bonus to sunder attacks and athletics checks to break things.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Path of Ruin</mark>

Whenever you take the charge action, you automatically destroy obstacles, cover and difficult terrain that is of solid or lesser toughness. Anything harder you get a free attempt to break it. You can charge directly into the air and are immune to fall damage any round you charge. You have resistance to all damage when you charge.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Devour</mark>

You gain the swallow monster quality. Deals 3d8 (13) poison damage.\

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - The Succ \[sonic] \[air]</mark>

Once per minute you can inhale with such sudden force as to evacuate the air in its proximity, causing a sudden wave of air pressure from the implosion. All creatures and loose objects within 30 feet of the you take (2d6+d6/odd lvl) sonic damage and are pulled adjacent to you (fort halves damage and negates pull).\
Swallowed creatures are also affected and automatically fail their save.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Endless Abyss (Su)</mark>

You become a pure destructive force of the universe to such a degree that you can manifest the Endless Abyss. This takes the form of a black hole that is integrated into your body somehow (replaces eye, in the back of the throat, or something more exotic like the dark star skins in league) and is immediately recognized as dangerous by most.

You can choose to annihilate objects that you comes into contact with, absorbing them into the abyss, as long as you are larger than them. You can concentrate for 1 minute to allow the Abyss to consume a defeated creature within reach. Add 1 to your soul counter. For every soul consumed, you can regurgitate an annihilated object or creature. Regurgitated creatures and objects are in the same state they were in when they were annihilated.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Eater of Souls (Su) \[healing] \[teleportation] \[overheal]</mark>

Whenever a creature within reach is defeated, you consume a piece of its soul and recover 10 hp. If they are within 60 ft of you, you can teleport adjacent to them as an immediate action to get a nibble of that soul.\
You can only munch a specific creature's soul 1/day.
