# ⛓️ Unchained

Unchained shifters are all about inflicting as much pain upon themselves and others as possible. They take their favorite parts of other creatures and add it to themselves.

Your specialization is martial. Your technique trees are **barbarism** and **beastmode.**

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - First Seal: Shackled (Su)</mark>

When you break the first seal, 4 spiked chains burst from your back that you can make attacks with (deals crush damage). They function as additional opposable limbs that can be used to hold objects, climb walls, grapple creatures etc. The chains have an additional 5 feet of reach during your turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Second Seal: Share my Pain (Su)</mark>

When you break the second seal, your chains now have an additional 10 ft of reach during your turn. You can innately cast [shackles of pain](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/necromancy/level-5/shackles-of-pain) as a swift action, taking up one of your shackles while the effect persists. Instead of its usual range, it has a range of reach. It also has an altered effect. It does not reduce any of the damage you take, but instead causes chained creatures to take half the damage you take as true damage.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Final Seal: Generosity (Su) \[fear]</mark>

When you break the final seal, your chains now have an additional 15 ft of reach during your turn. Your share my pain feature can target up to 4 creatures within reach at once.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Infernal Shackle (Su)</mark>

By spending 1 mana when you land an attack against a creature with your chains or claws, you can shackle them. One of your chains pops out of your body and stays put at the point they were at when you attacked them. At the end of their next turn, they are pulled back to that position and your chain returns to you. The chain immediately breaks if the creature gets more than 60 feet away, or if someone uses athletics to break it as a standard action.

In any case, escaped chains reappear attached to you.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Bits and Pieces</mark>

After a battle, you can peruse the bodies of your defeated foes for pieces of them you like, such as their eyes, teeth, feathers, scales etc. You can surgically remove them with your claws and add them to yourself after 1 minute, either replacing that part of your body or you somehow make room. Increase your max hp by 1 each piece.\
The parts need to be fresh, so waiting for more than 5 minutes ruins their potency. Unchained shifters are a bit picky and will only add pieces of creatures of their level or higher (though they won't retroactively remove pieces as they level up). \
You can have a maximum of (3+3\*lvl) pieces.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Return the Favor</mark>

Gain combat reflexes as a bonus feat.\
Whenever you provoke an AoO, the attacking creature provokes an AoO from you. The act of provoking isn't enough and the creature can simply opt to not attack you to deprive you of your AoO.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Flesh Wound \[healing] \[overheal]</mark>

Whenever you take damage, keep a running tally of how much damage you have taken. After 1 minute of not taking damage, restore half of this value as hp. Any \[healing] effect that does not grant temp hp subtracts twice the healing amount from this value.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Masochism</mark>

You can attack yourself, dealing damage as normal, requiring no attack roll. You gain +2 attack and +10 speed for 1 minute after doing so. If an ally attacks you, or includes you in the AoE of an effect that deals damage, you also get this bonus. Any damage you take during your turn has 100% effectiveness against creatures shackled by share my pain.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Battered and Bruised</mark>

While at or below 50% hp, you have +2 AC, +2 to all DCs you inflict and +2 to all saves.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Sadism</mark>

On-hit your attacks apply a stacking debuff (similar to shaken/sickened) called pain. Pain gives a creature weakness 1 to all damage types. Any \[healing] effect removes all pain stacks.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Sharing is Caring (Sp)</mark>

You can use your _share my pain_ feature on allies. Instead of its usual effect, it causes them to take half damage, redirecting the mitigated damage back to you.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Shadenfreude (Su) \[healing]</mark>

Whenever an enemy within 60 ft of you fails a skill check, fails to even graze with an attack or fails a saving throw, you restore 5 hp. This healing does not interfere with flesh wound's healing.
