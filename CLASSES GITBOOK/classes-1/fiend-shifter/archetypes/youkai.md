# ðŸ‘º Youkai

Youkai shifters have a powerful being sealed inside of them. As their relationship deepens, so too does their power. Youkai abilities are inspired by Japanese folklore.

&#x20;Your starting spell list is **Moogan** and **???**

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - First Seal: Spirit Guide</mark>

When you break the first seal, you gain FH 1 while below half hp. When you roll a natural 1, your youkai spirit intervenes, allowing you to reroll it as an immediate action. You can break the first (second and final) seal as an immediate action to activate this reroll ability.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Second Seal: Spirit Cooperation</mark>

When you break the second seal, your FH increases to 2 while below half hp, and you gain FH 1 when at or above half hp. Even when you are deprived actions (such as being staggered, dazed or defeated), your youkai spirit can take any of the actions listed in the below abilities.\
**Spirit Siege, Spirit Guide, Spirit Guardian**

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Final Seal: Quickened Spirit</mark>

When you break the final seal, your FH turns into regeneration, stopped by poison or fire damage. Through you and your youkai spirit acting in tandem, you gain an additional swift action each turn.

### Fiendish Growths

Numbers indicate level requirements (6 total)

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Blood Claws (Su)</mark>

As long as you are missing hp or are bleeding, you can use this ability.\
1/rnd you can make a claw attack as though it was a thrown weapon (20/40 range) by digging your claws into your wound and throwing blades of blood at an enemy.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Vigilance</mark>

Your youkai spirit is always watching over you, even when you do not manifest it. You get a +4 bonus to initiative and perception. You do not take a penalty to perception while sleeping.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Spirit Guardian</mark>

In combat your spirit actively participates to defend you. You cannot be flanked. Your spirit can possess your body and move with a 30 ft hover speed and automatically spend your standard action to disengage, even if you lack those actions from being stunned for example. When you are defeated, creatures must still beat your AC or poise break you to attack/move you and you can still make reflex saves.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Spirit Snatcher (Su)</mark>

When you grapple a creature, your spirit also grabs a piece of their soul, making them fatigued. If you are not poise broken by the start of your next turn, your spirit devours this piece of soul. The creature you grappled becomes drained 1 and you regain (the creature's lvl) HP. A creature can only be affected by spirit snatcher 1/day.\
The creature remains fatigued for as long as they have the drained condition.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Destructive Tendencies</mark>

You grow a third eye, giving you the ability to innately cast glimpse of truth 1/day.\
As a swift action, you can fire a laser beam from this eye. Roll a d4 to see what you get, then choose a target. Make an attack roll as though using a thrown weapon (20, 40). It deals 3d6 (10) damage with a random type and bonus effect.&#x20;

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="149"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 - Smoke</td><td>[Fire] damage. Creature has blurred vision for 1 round.</td></tr><tr><td>2 - Blood</td><td>[Poison] damage. Heal the damage you deal.</td></tr><tr><td>3 - Shadow</td><td>[Necrotic] damage. Creature is bone chilled for 1 round.</td></tr><tr><td>4 - Ice</td><td>[Cold] damage. Creature has its speed reduced by 15 for 1 round.</td></tr></tbody></table>

You can decide which eye beam you would like to use, but doing so closes your third eye, disabling this ability for 1 minute. You cannot use this ability while blinded or while you have blurred vision.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Spirit Siege</mark>

Your youkai spirit plays a much more active role in combat. It is capable of dashing around the battlefield before quickly returning to defend you once again. As a swift action, limited to once each round, you can command your spirit to do one of the following actions. Its attacks donâ€™t suffer your MA penalty.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="93"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Crush</td><td>Melee attack a creature within 30 feet. It is stunned for 1 turn on hit with no other effect (fort reduces to stagger)</td></tr><tr><td>Block</td><td>You gain improved cover against 1 specific creature. Spaces moving towards you are considered difficult terrain for the creature.</td></tr><tr><td>Slice</td><td>Make a simple attack against the creature within 30 ft using your claw damage.</td></tr></tbody></table>
