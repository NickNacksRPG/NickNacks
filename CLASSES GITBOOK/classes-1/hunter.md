You can only have 1 creature marked at a time. You get a +4 bonus to survival checks against a marked creature. Choose one additional effect your hunters mark has while the mark persists.

<mark style="color:green;">Reveal</mark> - Creature glows slightly, giving it a visible colorful aura. Creature cannot hide and and all attacks against it have seeking.\
<mark style="color:green;">Taunt</mark> - The creature you strike is taunted by you until it damages you, upon which the mark is removed.

As an immediate action when a creature makes an attack against a marked creature, you can transform that attack into a crit. Using this function of Hunter's Mark causes the ability to be unusable until you rest. Otherwise this special attack can be used at will.
