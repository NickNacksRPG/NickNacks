# Rogue

Masters of stealth, infiltration and execution. The rogue is "that guy" someone knows who's the man for the job. The rogue is the guy who knows people higher up in town as much as those in the underbelly of society. Out-skill and outsmart your foes with the power of planning, tactics and playing dirty.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Martial)</mark>

You gain 1 technique point at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on the scoundrel and tree.

Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Mobility</mark>

Movement through occupied/threatened spaces is \[elusive] unless you leave a creature's threatened zone.\
At any point during your movement, you can move 10 feet back along the path you originally took. This movement doesn't count against your total movement and is always \[elusive].

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Serendipity</mark>

Gain a +5 bonus to serendipity checks (see luck for more details).\
Whenever you roll on a random chart, you have advantage. If this roll is usually made in secret, you know both results and can choose between them regardless.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Signature Skill</mark>

Get the signature skill feat without needing the prerequisites. Get an additional signature skill at level 6 and 10.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Cunning Action</mark>

Gain an additional standard action or swift action that cannot be used to attack, use supernatural abilities or cast spells. Attacks involve anything that directly negatively impacts an enemy, not just attack rolls.\
Specific class features allow you to do specific things with cunning action that you normally couldn't.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Evasion</mark>

You take half damage from reflex saves. If you pass a reflex save, it deals no damage and has no other additional effect.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Talented</mark>

Rogue has a selection of special abilities unique to them. Gain one this level and at levels 4, 6, 8 and 10.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Stroke of Luck</mark>

(1+Luck) times per day, you can force a specific serendipitous event as a free action. Advantageous scenarios could be something like a cart of hay to catch your fall, or a bird smashing into a window to get a guard to investigate. Things with a DC 15 happen automatically. Anything higher requires a roll.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Reliable Talent</mark>

If you roll less than a 10 on a skill check, treat the final result as though you rolled a 10.
