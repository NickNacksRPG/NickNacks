# Mastermind

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Mastermind \[recharge]</mark>

You are ready for anything, and you can plan perfectly for any situation. You gain a Potential Pool. You can sacrifice money, inventory space and carry weight, gambit slots, spend time, visit places, and place yourself in beneficial situations to add to this pool. The possibilities are nearly limitless. It is intentionally nebulous, and what you do with your money and time is undetermined until you use your Mastermind ability.

Once you have a good amount of resources in this pool, you can, as a free action at any time, produce a flashback to a time when you used them to produce an item or outcome in the current situation. For example, if you have a month of time and some gold in the pool, you can recall a time when you took courses in a language that is being spoken in the moment, and retroactively record what your actions were to perfectly tailor them to the situation.&#x20;

As long as the plan is simple, realistic, and easily achieved, you need only spend your resources to cause the event to happen. If it's a bit more complex, such as sneaking items into a location, you can expend resources to try and get it to happen, but may need to roll a skill check to have it be successful; otherwise, you lose any potential that you would have used attempting to succeed at that task.

This ability has a cooldown of 5 minutes. Exceptionally cheap or mundane items/plans have no cooldown.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Quick Thinking</mark>

Gain a pool of D8 dice (1+1/2 lvl+Int) . These can be used on any physical ability check or skill check, saving throw, or attack roll, even after learning the results of the check to make it succeed retroactively.\
This ability cannot be used to exceed what would otherwise be the maximum result (such as 28 for d20+8).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Shrodinger's Pockets (Sp)</mark>

While wearing any clothes with pockets, your inventory (that isn't exposed to the world) functions as an arcane pocket with 20 extra pounds. If someone thoroughly searches you, you may use Sleight of Hand to conceal the presence of any items on you.

Tip: When added to your Potential Pool, you may use Mastermind to retroactively determine that your inventory is empty after a failed attempt to conceal it, after which you must place yourself in a situation to add it back to your Potential Pool. This is the origin of the ability's name.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Fast Hands</mark>

Gain Sleight of Hand as a free skill with a +4 bonus. You can roll sleight of hand instead of deception when feinting creatures.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Professional Thief</mark>

You may use Sleight of Hand in place of a Profession skill of your choice (typically related to illicit or dubiously moral activities, or businesses that tend to facilitate such). This ability counts as having the Profession skill for qualification purposes.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Power Thief</mark>

When you successfully hit a DD creature, you may use your Cunning Action to cast Dispel Magic on them, targeting a \[buff] spell they have on themselves. If you succeed, you steal the buff for its remaining duration. If it was also \[concentration], you begin concentrating on it.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Wealth</mark>

Immediately gain 10% of your character's current wealth as bonus wealth that appears in your Potential Pool. Upon finding any loot or income in the future, even as a party, you automatically gain 10% of the loot's value added to your pool. Up to GM discretion to determine what counts, to avoid farming wealth with recurrent sales and repurchases.
