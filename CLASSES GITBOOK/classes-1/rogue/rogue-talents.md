## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Never Lucky (Su) \[recharge]</mark>

Using your cunning action, you can cause an unfortunate event to occur against a creature within 30 ft of you. This event is harmful and sudden, such as a lightning strike on a clear day, a large creature falling on them from the sky or a brick falling loose from the wall next to them. They take 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) and are clumsy 1 (reflex halves dmg and negates clumsy). The damage type depends on the effect, but the damage can never be something that the target has resistance or immunity to.

The DC increases by 2 if you use this ability after the target says something like "that would never happen" or "may the gods strike me down if my cause is not righteous" or something to that effect.

Recharges after 1 minute.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - All Calculated</mark>

If you miss or graze a creature while threatening another creature, you can choose to instead roll a new attack against the second target as an immediate action. If the initial target was DD, so is the secondary target.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Escape Artistry</mark>

You can escape manacles, vines, webs, rope, grapples and more using sleight of hand instead of the usual method. If you would normally escape through athletics, then use the athletics DC. If you are grappled, then roll sleight of hand opposed to the grappling creatures reflex save. If there is not predetermined action type for the effect, it is a standard action.

You gain advantage on this check while nobody is watching you.\
You can also use this to assist an ally to escape from these conditions too.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Watch How It's Done \[mana burn]</mark>

When a creature you can see fails a skill check, you can spend 1 mana to "try it yourself." You automatically achieve their result and add your luck to it. If you succeed, you remove the mana burn.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Natural Order</mark>

Certain places are well known for particular events. Markets have big sales, shady bars have fights, lively inns have parties etc. You can roll an appropriate skill check in order to spark such events. Roll profession to start a fire sale, roll intimidation to goad some drunkards into a scrap or roll perform to get people dancing. This can apply to any number of situations and skill rolls like prison riots, chanting crowds, sea shanties etc.

The DC is 20. The effect is usually to stir people up in public places, so without others present, this doesnâ€™t do much. These events are usually temporary only lasting a few minutes.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Fancy Meeting You Here \[recharge]</mark>

1/day, choose a location, person or item you can see with 60 ft. Whenever an event of significance happens to the thing you chose, such as a creature cracking at your safe, walking into an abandoned building or petting your dog, you can choose to roll serendipity to happen to be in the nearby area to witness it happen. What is considered "significant" can have a higher degree of specificity, such as "an orc pets my dog," but it increases the DC.

This usually only allows you to attend to things in your nearby area, such as in your city. When you succeed on serendipity, you happen to wake up to use the bathroom, you do a late night milk run or you got a tip in advance. Typically the DC is 10, with circumstances such as distance, specificity, what you are doing when the event happens and how accessible what you chose to keep your eye on can increase the DC, with unfavorable circumstances adding +2, and downright ridiculous ones (like being in a prison after visiting hours) adding +4, up to a maximum of DC 20.

Certain physical limitations, such as being unable to keep tabs on something a country away, can make using this ability impossible. You can keep tabs on (1+luck) things at a time.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Kip Up</mark>

As a free action, end the knockdown condition.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Quick Study \[recharge]</mark>

By spending 1 hour doing research or practicing, you can become proficient in a particular skill for the rest of the day. Certain skills may require facilities or equipment in order to properly practice (such as a library for knowledge skills, or thieves tools for sleight of hand).

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Black Market Connections</mark>

You can sell any item, no questions asked, so long as you are in a place you could consider a city. While inside of a city, you can also spend a few hours to figure out the kinds of illegal things that people sell there such as things related to forbidden magic, or human trafficking, and where you can purchase said items.

You have enough street cred to trade with such vendors without requiring any checks. If you unearth this operation, such as by telling proper authorities or the public, you lose this street cred. This also happens if an ally you bring does so.&#x20;

Whenever you sell an item, you get 60% of the items value instead of 50% by default.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Fortune Filch</mark>

You can spend a daily use of stroke of luck to cause an unattended, loose handheld object within 60 ft to instantly end up in your hands. The way this happens is usually very dramatic and unlikely, changing based on the scenario. A plank in the floor goes loose, catapulting a key towards you when someone steps nearby. A leak springs in your ship next to you, causing the item to spill out.

You never need to roll to achieve the desired result.
