# Vigilante

You aren't the hero we need, just the one we deserve. Vigilantes are characters that live different lives by night and by day. By day you live your life as youâ€™ve always lived it. By night, you live as an alternate persona with the power to enact change in the world.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Secret Identity</mark>

You have an alternate identity, with its own name and specific appearance. A secret identity usually has a very unusual outfit, and it always covers the face. Changing between your normal and secret identity requires 3 rounds and some privacy, lest the secret is revealed. Only a handful of trusted individuals are privy to the vigilantes true identity.

When using your secret identity, you change your mannerisms, voice, clothes and even more dramatic things about your appearance, making you unrecognizable to even your closest friends. Even magic cannot distinguish the two. For example if you are asked about information only told to your true identity, truth detecting magic cannot tell the user of any lies about what you know. Magical attempts to locate your secret identity fail if you are in your true identity etc.

If you are defeated or otherwise incapacitated and a creature takes a FRA to reveal you while in your secret identity, they can discover your true identity. Creatures that know your true identity ignore your resistance to magical and nonmagical detection by swapping identities.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Secret Lair</mark>

For vigilantes that stick in one place, they can spend 1 week to locate/create a location secluded from the surrounding area. Located in sewers, caves, abandoned buildings and the like, the secret lair is a safe location. Any mundane attempts to find the lair must beat a DC (25+lvl) check to locate it. Such attempts usually cannot be made without some kind of hint, such as chasing you as you return to it. Magic to locate the lair, or anybody inside, automatically fails.

The lair can be quite spacious, large enough to fit training areas, holding cells for your enemies and vaults for your valuables. There are several methods of reaching your lair from different locations. If needed, you can empty your secret lair within a day.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Signature Vehicle</mark>

You have connections with a talented engineer that can fashion you a unique vehicle. This vehicle is very sturdy and large enough to comfortably hold 6 medium creatures, in addition to you. You get access to 3 different mobility upgrades from the pilot archetype of mechanic.

If the vehicle is targeted with any attacks or harmful effects then use your saves, AC, etc to figure out what happens. The vehicle is treated as an object to determine how it is affected by harmful effects. It has half your hp. If it falls to 0, it is inoperable.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - The Signal</mark>

You have a 6th sense for specific sights and sounds that indicate people require your assistance such as a symbol displayed in the clouds from a light, or a type of whistle. You can sense these automatically when they happen within a mile of you, and you know its exact position. 1/day when such a signal occurs, you can change into your secret identity and travel to where the signal happened from within 1 minute.
