## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Terrorize</mark>

As a free action once per round, use Intimidate to Demoralize.\
If you use your Cunning Action to Demoralize, it affects all enemies within 30ft.\
Your attacks against shaken creatures get a +4 bonus. Treat all targets that are frightened as DD and get a +4 bonus to attack as though they were shaken.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Kidnap</mark>

You can use cunning action to make a free drag attempt against a DD target.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Skill</mark>

Gain Intimidate as a free skill with a +4 bonus. You can use it in place of profession, albeit at the cost of reputation.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Bullying Blow</mark>

At the start of your turn as a swift action, you can decide to forfeit the ability to make combat maneuvers until the start of your next turn. When you do so, your attacks deal poise damage equal to the hp damage they deal until the start of your next turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Special Attack: Kneecapper</mark>

Strike at a foes legs, causing them to be damaged on-hit.  The first time a turn the creature attempts to move, it experiences great pain, causing it to take 2d6 (7) true damage and get knocked down (fort negates).

If the creature has only attempted to move, and it falls over, then it may swap equipment to change strategies even though it isn't the start of its turn.

This effect lasts until the creature is healed, usually requiring some type of check. Fast healing requires a check that only adds the creatures level, and regen makes that check with advantage. Can also be healed with the medicine skill, or healing abilities, usually requiring a CL check to heal the wound.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Blackmail</mark>

You can use your intimidation bonus in place of your persuasion bonus to persuade and gather information. After you do, you generally have a worse reputation and the DC increases by 10 the next time you attempt it in the same roundabout location.&#x20;

If you are speaking to a specific individual, you can roll a DC 20 knowledge local check (you can make this check untrained) to learn something incredibly embarrassing, unsavory or unbecoming of them to automatically succeed on this check. If you already have such a piece of information, no checks are required.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Menace</mark>

When you demoralize a creature that has been shaken for at least 1 round, you can instead choose to make them frightened frightened for 1 round. This can only apply to a creature 1/minute.

You ignore the \[elusive] tag against shaken or frightened enemies.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Smell Fear</mark>

You gain blindsense (Scent, 20 ft) against any shaken or frightened creature.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Run and Hide</mark>

When you frighten a creature and the creature is within reach of you, the frightened condition does not end until they use the hide action.
