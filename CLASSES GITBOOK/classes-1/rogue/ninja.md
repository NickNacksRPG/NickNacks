# Ninja

Ninjas are a special breed of rogues that heavily focus around using a set of supernatural powers that aid them in espionage and misdirection. Their signature ability, shadow clone, makes them able to exist in many places at once, vastly increasing their ability to gather information.

Not historically accurate, but its more fun this way C:

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Shadow Clone (Su) \[companion]</mark>

You can spend a standard action to cause an exact copy of yourself to appear in an adjacent space. A brief cloud of smoke appears to obscure who the real one is (flip a coin to see if you target the one you intend to). If you are hiding when you do this, so is the clone. In most aspects, the creature functions exactly as you do with respect to things like attack, damage, saving throws etc. Whenever they expend a resource, such as mana, a consumable item, or ammunition, it gets expended for you as well, including contributing to the [cap on techniques used per turn](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/#using-multiple-techniques-a-turn). The clone gets all of its own actions, it reasons just as well as you do and follows your direct orders, but you have no supernatural ability to communicate with it over long distances.

The clone automatically disappears when it fails a saving throw against anything or takes any damage. When the clone dies, or you dismiss it, you instantly gain all of its memories back, as though you had experienced the events yourself. There is no range limit on how far the clone can get from you. If a creature has reason to suspect you aren't the real you, they roll perception vs your class DC or 10+your disguise bonus, whichever is higher.

You can have a maximum of 1 shadow clone out at once. When you make a shadow clone, you are still the "real you" and the clone is still a fake.&#x20;

Remembering your clone's experiences can be traumatic. If one is killed, roll a DC 9 luck check. On a fail, gain an affliction. You (or the clone itself on mission complete) can cause a clone to safely disappear as a free action.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This ability is incredibly versatile and has the ability to completely warp the game. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to exploit this ability, but the DM should not be afraid to not let certain things work. For instance, if you share the same resources and then a clone sits in a nearby safe place to spam some kind of mana restoration effect. This is clearly against the spirit of the ability. Don't let it happen.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Light Steps (Su) \[concentration]</mark>

You can start concentrating on this ability as a free action.\
As long as you only move during your turn and take no other action, you can walk along any flat continuous surface. This can include things that aren't even otherwise solid such as water or lava. It can also include things such as walls or ceilings.

You can use this ability for only part of your turn to get to a location, but if you attack, cast a spell etc, then you need be on a surface you would normally be able to stand on or you plummet.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Fade Away (Su)</mark>

While you stand completely still and take no action on your turn, you are affected as per [invisibility](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-6/invisibility) until you do. This can also happen if you are unable to move or take actions, such as when stunned.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Bothersome Buddies (Su)</mark>

You can spend 2 mana as a swift action to use shadow clone to instantly create 3 clones, but they do not leave your space or scar you on death. This functions as [mirror image](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/wildcard/level-2/mirror-images).

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Smoke Bomb (Su)</mark>

By spending 2 mana and your cunning action, you can create a cloud of dense smoke in a 10 ft radius around you and hide. It typically only lasts a 3 rounds, but can last 1 in windy environs or it doesn't work at all during storms. Other types of \[air] effects can cause it to disperse more quickly as well.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Substitution (Su) \[recharge] \[teleportation]</mark>

By spending 3 mana as an immediate action, you can cause an unattended object within 30 ft of you to be the target of your attack instead of you, such as a log, furniture etc. You take the place of the object you used and you immediately [vanish](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-1/vanish) until the end of your next turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Eyes Everywhere</mark>

Shadow Clone gains the \[scrying] tag, allowing you to witness what they see while concentrating.
