## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Ditto</mark>

Every hero proudly presents their finest victory in the form of a pet ditto: An ooze creature that can mimic the appearance of a creature that the hero has defeated in battle. functioning as a familiar. It knows a number of transformations equal to your level. If you choose to teach it a new form and it has no more slots, it forgets a previous one permanently. New transformations must at least match the level of its highest known transformation. It starts play only knowing 1 transformation of a level 0 creature. A ditto can never transform into a creatures with class levels.

Your ditto becomes a level 0 copy, losing all defense traits (outside of base stats), offense traits (outside of its attacks) and feats. Its stats are obviously adjusted to be a level 0 creature, effectively subtracting its level from things like AC, saves, poise etc. Its hp is 20. Its size is always tiny.
