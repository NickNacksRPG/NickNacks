# Sentinel

The Sentinel Slayer trades many of the abilities granted by the original slayer class to pivot the class from an unrelenting aggressor to a more defensive play style. Instead of killing everything that moves, a sentinel focuses more on disruption and setting up combos. The class primarily revolves around parrying enemy attacks.

Removes: Glory Kill, Dash, Shredder, Feats, Blood Punch

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Energy (Su)</mark>

You no longer have glory kill, so that method of regaining energy is removed.

Instead you regain 2 energy when you successfully parry an attack.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Sawblade Shield</mark>

You start play with and can craft a circular shield with spinning blades inside of it with 8 hours of work and 100g. This is treated as a tower shield and a 1h weapon that can deal slash or crush damage and has the CM (shove) and CM (bully) properties. If this shield is sundered or destroyed, it repairs itself after 1 round.&#x20;

In the hands of a Sentinel, the shield also additional properties. It has the thrown property and 2 enchantment slots, one of which is the [returning](https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/magic-items/magic-weapon-properties) enchantment, but the returning can be used as an instant action.

You can reasonably augment existing shields to also make them better suit your tastes, giving them the above properties.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Omniparry</mark>

Any offensive ability that deals damage to you, you can parry. Roll an attack roll as an immediate action. Against opposing attack rolls, if you match their roll, you negate it. Against anything else if you match the DC of the ability, you negate it entirely (at least for you in the case of AoE effects).

When you successfully parry any ability, you <mark style="color:red;">rupture</mark> your attacker and any other enemies within 10 ft of them, making them clumsy 2 and setting them to 1 poise.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">But how do I determine my attack bonus for parrying?</mark>

You use what your melee attack bonus would be against the target. If you are currently flanking the target, add flanking. If your shield has the bane enchantment against their creature type, add bane.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Energy: Onslaught \[elusive]</mark>

As a free action, spend 2 energy to dash directly adjacent to a creature within 30 ft and crash into them, releasing a powerful shockwave. The target creature and all enemies within 10 ft are staggered (fort negates).

Instead of a shockwave, you can instead choose to shove the target.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Sawed Off</mark>

When you make a thrown attack with your shield, it embeds itself into a creature on hit, entangling them. If at the end of the creatures turn it is still entangled by this, it takes your shield attack damage again. If you choose to use the returning property of your shield to parry, shield action etc, this entangle ends.

When a creature is a minion, you know. You do not need to make attack rolls with your shield against minions. They are automatically crit by your shield attacks. If you defeat a minion with a shield attack, it can bounce to another minion within 20 ft.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Feats</mark>

You gain the shield focus, sentinel and point blank master feats.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Shield Runes (Su)</mark>

Inscribe a rune upon your shield to give it additional powers that activate when you successfully parry. You can only activate 1 rune when you parry.\
Choose one at this level and another at level 6 and 10,

<mark style="color:green;">Quaking Rune</mark> - All <mark style="color:red;">ruptured</mark> creatures are also staggered.\
<mark style="color:green;">Vengeful Rune</mark> - Your next onslaught against a <mark style="color:red;">ruptured</mark> creature costs no energy. If you are within range, you can use onslaught as an instant action.\
<mark style="color:green;">Celestial Rune</mark> - All <mark style="color:red;">ruptured</mark> creatures are smited by divine power, taking 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) holy damage.\
<mark style="color:green;">Cursed Rune</mark> - All <mark style="color:red;">ruptured</mark> creatures gain weakness 2 to all damage.

\
<mark style="color:green;">Ligma Rune</mark> - All <mark style="color:red;">ruptured</mark> creatures contract ligma.
