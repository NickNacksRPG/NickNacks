# Fate Spinner

Many people wish they could see the future, but the fate spinners are the only ones who truly understand the nature of this burden. Fate spinners are frequently humbled by their power to see into the future and the struggle to change it. You gain unique boons with drawbacks associated with them, and a deck of cards to twist fate with on a whim.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - MM: Fortunetelling</mark>

Draw a card from your deck as a swift action. See card results for more details.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Cursed</mark>

Fatespinners, oracles and the like tend to draw the ire from the gods for meddling with the future. They each suffer from a unique curse that provides them with unique challenges and benefits. See the curses section for more details.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Oracle's Premonition \[recharge]</mark>

Your mind is plagued by visions of the future. During carefully curated rituals, speaking in tongues, wild highs on psychoactive drugs or delivered in dreams, you receive premonitions about future events. These premonitions generally focus on great tragedies soon to befall subjects that are relevant to you. This could be important people, places of significance, valuable artifacts,  ancient evils and other such things.

As far as fine mechanics go, the ritual requires at least one hour of uninterrupted concentration. Generally the subject of these premonitions are focused around a specific subject, sometimes of your choosing, sometimes not. The premonitions are not required to give a precise answer.

This next part is as much for the DM as it is the player.

<mark style="color:green;">As an example</mark>. You could divine things about the organization causing strife in this city.\
"Suddenly you are far away in the nation's capital city. You see brief flashes of the decorations of the summer festival, and a dark amorphous blob moving through the streets. You see many silhouettes moving into the kings castle. The only discernible detail you can see from them is an insignia on the hood of their robes. You hear a voice. 'Today is the day the tyrant is killed.' And then the vision transforms into a beautiful oasis filled with winged horses, before quickly fading."

Some important takeaways…

* You ALWAYS focus on the event, not the outcome. In order to be a premonition given to presumably change the future, the information must be actionable. (the king is danger!)
* You ALWAYS know the WHEN of the event, down to the minute. Other details like where and who can be discovered. (its happening during the summer festival!)
* You ALWAYS receive some kinds of sensory clues. Voices, symbols, colors, smells, temperature must be present. (robed figures with a noticeable insignia, some large black ooze and the voice of someone important)
* You ALWAYS receive something that you can affect within the prescribed time. Either the vision tells you about something nearby,or the vision also includes similar types of clues for how you might get to these faraway places. (you'd never be able to get there in time…unless you could fly using a pegasus)

As for the \[recharge] tag. Depending on the pacing of your campaign, your premonitions might reveal information regarding events that are to happen within weeks, months or years. Generally a fate spinner should have a premonition once each major story arc. No matter what though, a fate spinner cannot have premonitions about a new subject before the events of his current premonition transpire.

If you or your DM deem this ability too annoying or disruptive for play...gain an extra technique point and then another each odd level.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Fated</mark>

Fatespinners have an innate sense of how far they can push fate before fate pushes back. You gain a pool of 10 luck. Whenever you add luck to a roll, you can choose to add any amount of this luck pool to the roll. You can add this luck after you fail a check, with your GM telling you how much is needed to pass the check.

This pool resets to 10 when you rest.

You can <mark style="color:red;">push your luck</mark>, going negative up to 10 points. Whenever you do, you gain a unique affliction.

T3 Affliction: <mark style="color:green;">Out of Luck</mark> - You cannot add luck to your rolls.

<mark style="color:green;">Cure</mark> - Pay homage to the gods to make up for meddling in their affairs. You must do this a number of days equal to your negative luck pool when you gained this affliction. Paying homage can include spending time at a place of worship or assisting leaders of a religion.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note, because you can no longer add luck to rolls with this affliction, you also cannot use your fated luck pool. This means when you go negative, even if only -1, you cannot then later choose to go even more negative.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Threads of Fate</mark>

You can see the silvery thread that floats above a creatures head, connecting them to the heavens above. This thread is loosely connected to other people, locations and objects. Unless a creature is also a fate spinner, you can wrap this thread around your finger without bringing much attention to yourself while within 10 ft of them, <mark style="color:red;">tethering</mark> you to the creature. While <mark style="color:red;">tethered</mark>...

* You can always follow this thread to lead you to this person. The thread is ethereal and ignores physical terrain, leading in a direct line to this creature, causing potential problems when tracking someone in a dense building, underground or on the other side of world.
* When in the presence of people, places or objects of significance to the creature, you can see faint threads connecting their tether to them.
* The tethered creature remembers you very clearly from any previous encounter you had with them after you tethered to them, even events that happened before the tether.

You can only <mark style="color:red;">tether</mark> to a single creature at a time, losing any previous ties if you tether a new creature.
