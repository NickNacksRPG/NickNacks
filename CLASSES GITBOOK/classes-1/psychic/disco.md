# Disco

Your psyche is fragmented, rendering some parts of your brain inaccessible. This allows them to develop thoughts on their own, and chime in with their own insights when the situation calls for it. As a result, disco psychics are able maintain multiple trains of thought, giving unique insights into situations that surpass leaps of logic and enter the realm of the supernatural.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Compartmentalization</mark>

Your mind is fragmented into 4 different parts: The self, the body, instinct and intellect. Each part of your mind is special in its ability to focus on specific things.

* <mark style="color:purple;">The self</mark> is related to charisma, and represents an aspect of yourself that gets along with others. Things such as cooperation, empathizing and commanding others.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">The body</mark> is related to str/dex, and represents an aspect of yourself that interacts with material reality. Repairing or breaking things, flexing on people and sleight of hand.
* <mark style="color:red;">Instinct</mark> is related to wisdom, and represents an aspect of yourself that can see the unseen. Things such as gut feelings and hunches.
* <mark style="color:blue;">Intellect</mark> is related to intelligence, and represents an aspect of yourself that knows information. Things such as logic, mathematics and knowledge.

As an instant action before you roll a skill check, you can choose to add a d8 to it. If you fail the check, you lose a point of Mental Might. You cannot use this when you take 10/20.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Invoke Psyche</mark>

The fragments of your mind have much to say, but they can be pushed even further beyond. You can choose to invoke a particular fragment of your psyche. When you do spend a point of Mental Might. Roll a d8 and add the key ability score (choosing between str or dex as appropriate for the situation for the body). If the final result totals 6 or higher, you learn a far greater amount of information that you otherwise would have, or succeed in some other superlative fashion. If you fail, you glean nothing.

_For example_ if you invoke the <mark style="color:purple;">self</mark> during a war meeting to convince an enemy to agree to an armistice you might get something like...\
"The general is in a very difficult position. All the posturing and propaganda surrounding the war could fall apart if he agrees to this armistice. Worse yet, he could appear weak to his people; A death sentence to any military career, and this mans ambitions are high. If you want to convince him to an armistice, you need to do so in a way that doesn't shatter his reputation. Perhaps you should bring up that common enemy you have both been on the hunt for."

_Another example_ if you invoke <mark style="color:blue;">intellect</mark> in order to detect any patterns in an ongoing investigation on some wanted criminal you might get something like...\
"You are looking at the map and suddenly it all clicks. A circle! The attacks are all happening in cities along the outskirts in the country's territory. It reminds you of a much larger version of the circles you've seen with the cultists. The only part left of the circle is the center...The capital!"

In any case, you receive a large degree of information that might be available to your character, or can be gleaned from the clues you have seen up until this point, but might not click in your head as a player.&#x20;

Your GM may want to assign bonuses or penalties based on circumstances. A -1 for previously insulting the general or +1 for studying the magic circles in a library to use the previous examples.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The GM is the final arbiter in deciding whether or not you can invoke psyche at all. For example, you cannot invoke intellect to figure out who is the leader of a secret organization you know nothing about session 1.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Invocations</mark>

You can invoke aspects of your psyche to perform incredibly unusual feats. You gain an invocation at level 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Each one is color coded to decide which stat applies.

<mark style="color:red;">Shivers</mark> - The wind holds omens of the future, and you can feel it. You always invoke shivers when you want to find something. When you successfully invoke instinct with shivers, you get insight into the type of place whatever it is you are looking for is. You usually must still put clues together in order to narrow it down.

<mark style="color:purple;">Schizophrenia</mark> - The world itself speaks to you. You always invoke schizophrenia on objects of great significance. When you successfully invoke schizophrenia, the chosen object speaks to you. The frame of time it does so varies, but it typically only does so for 1 sitting. The object can relay information about creatures that have interacted with it in the past, like a piano of a musician or a sword of an ancient hero.&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">Visualization</mark> - Reshape the scene. You always invoke visualization to piece together how something played out based on physical traces left behind. When you successfully invoke visualization, you can re-imagine an event as it happens, with the vague silhouettes of creatures and objects moving in real time to allow you to determine details like size, shape, sequence and direction.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Activation</mark> - Start your engines. You always invoke activation in order to activate something. This could mean some kind of complex machine you normally couldn't make heads or tails of, how to open a door with no obvious handle or swing open a portcullis from outside of a fort. Activation may require a specific position or suitable tool to get full value.

<mark style="color:purple;">Mirror</mark> - Watch how it's done. You always invoke the mirror when you want to copy someone. You can mimic someones ability to quell an animal, speak a language or perform some type of skill. In any case, your mirror neurons can only do their magic if you have witnessed a creature in action within the last 10 minutes. You mimic the degree of success you witnessed, can speak the language for the duration of a conversation and otherwise temporarily mimic some behavior.

<mark style="color:blue;">Encyclopedia</mark> - Master of all trivia. You can invoke encyclopedia whenever you wish, and your brain produces random tidbits of information. When you succeed, you receive relatively detailed information about something specific, though it may not be what you were hoping for...Roll a luck check.

Lets pretend you are walking around a museum cataloguing ancient monsters called "Big Beasties"

* 1-6 - Your brain produces information completely unrelated to the situation at hand. Encyclopedia decides to inform you about a loving relationship between a lady and a giant ape.
* 7-13 - Your brain produces information tangentially relevant to the situation at hand. Encyclopedia tells you about other large creatures that exist and how the specimens you're looking at stack up to them.
* 14-20 - Your brain produces rather precise information about the situation at hand. Encyclopedia informs you about one of the specimens and its historical significance while it was still living.
