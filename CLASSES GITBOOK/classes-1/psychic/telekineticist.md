# Telekineticist

The telekineticist is most concerned with how their mental mastery can affect the physical world. They can manifest these psychic powers through telekinetic projections, both visible and invisible, to move things with their mind.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Telekinetic Blast (Su)</mark>

As a standard action you attack a foe within 30 ft by flinging an sharp, pointy or heavy object at them. The attack uses either str or dex as your attacking stat. If the creature is within reach, it can be a melee or ranged attack. If the creature is out of reach, it counts as a ranged attack. It's damage is 2d6+str/dex, increasing by d6 at level 3, and another d6 every odd level. The damage type is determined by the type of object you throw at your enemy.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Master Hand (Su) \[concentration]</mark>

You gain the mage hand cantrip and can use it for sleight of hand.

As a free action, you can manifest a large hand within 30 ft of you. This hand can manipulate objects and carry you and your allies, but it cannot attack. It can lift (400+100\*lvl) lbs. Any actions it takes consumes yours, including movement. The hand must end your turn at ground level if you ride it.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - MM: Force Field \[healing]</mark>&#x20;

Start each day with (5+lvl) temp hp that lasts forever. You can recharge this barrier as a standard action by spending 1 MM point.

While your forcefield persists, any on hit effects have no effect (such as bleed damage on a katana). Even if the hit breaks the barrier, dealing hp damage, the on hit effects do not apply.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Hover Master (Su)</mark>

You permanently gain a hover speed equal to your land speed.  You can hover sideways up walls or upside down on ceilings by adding the \[concentration] tag.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - MM: Hands Autonomy (Su)</mark>

As a free action, spend 1 MM point. You can cause your Master hand to not use your own actions for 1 turn, allowing it to move and pick things up, but not to attack.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - MM: Foe Throw (Su)</mark>

Take hold of a creature within 30 ft with your telekinesis and toss them 20 ft in any direction, dealing your blast damage (fort negates). You can toss the target at a specific creature with an attack roll to deal blast damage to them too.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Greater Blast</mark>

The damage dice of your elemental blast increases to d8

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - MM: Force Wall (Su)</mark>

You can create a 10x10 wall made out force anywhere within 30 ft, even in mid air, though not in any occupied space. It is a transparent tangible barrier that can be seen through, but creatures, objects and effects cannot pass through. It has (5\*lvl) hp. By sacrificing 5 of the walls hp, you can increase one dimension by 5 feet.

As a swift action, you can create a 5x5 wall that has 5 hp.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Innate Casting</mark>

You are persistently under the effect of the telekinetic maneuver spell, allowing you to toss others around whenever. Disappears if you gain another \[buff], but can be reapplied as a swift action.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - MM: Maelstrom (Su) \[persistent]</mark>

As a standard action, you can pick up unattended objects within 30 ft of you and cause them to swirl around you in a chaotic storm of debris for 1 minute. Creatures within 10 ft of you take 4d6 (14) slash, crush or pierce dmg, depending on what objects you pick up. This damage happens when a creature enters, starts or its turn in the area, but not both.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Greater Blast</mark>

The damage dice of your elemental blast increases to d10
