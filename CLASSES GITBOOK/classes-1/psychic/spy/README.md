# Spy

The spy is primarily concerned with information gathering and can do so in many ingenious ways.



## <mark style="color:green;">1 - MM: Glass Reflection</mark>

This ability and its progression are pretty complicated. See subsection for details.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Lip Reading</mark>

As long as you have a clear view of a creature and you understand the language that it's speaking, you need not hear it to understand it.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Familiar</mark>

Choose a level 0 fiend, celestial or fey, or create a beast that is automatically tiny using the Beast Trainer's Beast Companion feature. It's level is always 0. If it aids you in combat, it gains the \[companion] tag. You can also use your familiar to do a handful of other useful things.

<mark style="color:green;">Spying \[scrying]</mark> - You can sense through your companion at will. See the [scrying tag](https://app.gitbook.com/s/1UhIURz1UgUHbhhsNrtV/the-rules/publish-your-docs-7) for more details.\
<mark style="color:green;">Assistant</mark> - Your companion can use the aid action to assist you for any skill checks.\
<mark style="color:green;">To My Side \[teleportation]</mark> - You can concentrate for 3 rounds to teleport your companion to your side.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - MM: Mind Touch</mark>

When a creature fails a save against an effect you inflict, or you land an attack, you can affect the creature as though you had successfully cast detect thoughts on them as an immediate action. You briefly gain insight into their current plans, something that weighs heavily on their mind, or whatever seems most relevant at the time.

Alternatively, you can roll a knowledge check (including monster lore) using the creatures bonus. You intuitively know what knowledge skills it possesses.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - MM: All-Seeing Eye</mark>

Get a +2 bonus to perception.

You can pluck out your eye as a standard action and have it hover around autonomously with a speed of 40 on each of your turns. It has a tether range of 300 ft. You can pop it back into your head as an instant action if it moves into your space. You can simultaneously see through both your eye and your detached eye without mental strain.

The eye is blurry and insubstantial so it always has partial concealment. To perceive it, creatures need to make a DC 20 perception check, or DC 10+your stealth bonus.

It shares all of your statistics and is treated as you for all targeting purposes. AoE effects targeting both you and your eye only affect you once.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Innate Casting</mark>

You are persistently under the effect of detect thoughts allowing you to always peer into the thoughts of others. It loses the concentration tag and gains the \[buff] tag. If gain another buff, you can reactivate detect thoughts as a swift action.
