# Glass Reflection

This ability comes online at level 1, and improves at levels 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.

## <mark style="color:green;">Level 1</mark>

By performing a 1 hour ritual using a reflective surface, such as a mirror or a pool of water, you can see and hear remote locations. To do so you must name a specific creature you have met personally (Zeus, Jake from State Farm, Boo the miniature giant space hamster). You see the target creature as though you were floating overhead, using your own senses (will negates). Your vision radius is limited to only 10 ft around the target, but you can hear things as though you were present.

Passing a save against Glass Reflection (GR) gives the target an eerie feeling that they're being watched. Failing means they are unaware.

Possessing a personal possession of the creature (a book, weapon, article of clothing) gives them a -2 penalty to their save. Possessing a piece of the creature, such as a hair or some of their blood, gives them a -4 penalty. These penalties do not stack.

The range of this ability is finite. Generally speaking it should only function on creatures within city limits. This generally means it has a range of a few miles. You can spy on a creature for 10 minutes before the senor disappears. You can speak [telepathically](https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/monster-qualities/other-traitss#telepathy-su) to creatures visible in your GR.

You cannot target an unwilling creature with GR more than 1/day. A creature who has passed a save against your GR before always gets a perception check to see signs of magical spying with a DC (20+lvl) perception check when you initiate it. Without ways of interacting with magic they can do little to stop you, but they know you're there.

By contacting a creature ahead of time (such as via [sending](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/larella/level-1/sending)), you can automatically scry on a willing target without accepting mana burn.

The first use of Glass Reflection each day does not mana burn.

Any effects that prevent or otherwise interact with \[scrying] effects also interact with GR.
