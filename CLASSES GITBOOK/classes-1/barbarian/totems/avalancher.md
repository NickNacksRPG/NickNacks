# Avalancher

An avalancher is a warrior whose preferred home is amongst the clouds. Unfortunately most have to settle for mountains, trees or other tall structures. An avalancher fights by descending upon their foes with their signature attack: The Plunging Attack.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Special Attack: Plunging Attack \[recharge]</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
You can only plunging attack a creature after taking the jump action from an elevation higher than your original target.
{% endhint %}

Fall upon your foe, making a melee attack with advantage. Deal an additional 3 damage for every 10 feet you fall (capped at 3\*lvl). You deal an equal amount of poise damage. If this drops a creatures poise to zero, they are knocked down.

If you land or graze this hit, you negate all fall damage you would normally take.

You cannot use this attack in consecutive rounds, but otherwise at will.

You can choose to effect your voice as per the [amplify](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/wildcard/level-1/amplify) technique at will.&#x20;

You can choose to make your plunging attack deal sonic damage.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Mountaineer</mark>

You are unaffected by the oxygen-sparse environments typical of high elevation, and of the toxic gas environments typical of volcanic environments.

You can freely use both hands to use equipment while climbing, and you gain an additional 40 speed you can only use for climbing.
