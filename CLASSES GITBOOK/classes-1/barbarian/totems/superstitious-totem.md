# Superstitious Totem

Don't like magic? There's a totem for that. Now you can play the paranoid anti mage.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Totem Feature - Arc Training</mark>

You get knowledge (arcana) proficiency and can use it while raging.\
You gain 1 technique point you must spend on the Arc tree. Gain another at level 5 and 9.

## Rage Powers

Numbers are level requirements

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Superstitious (Su)</mark>

You get a +4 bonus on arcana checks.\
You see magical auras around creatures constantly. You know the highest level spell a creature can cast just by looking at them. You automatically get a perception check to see a creatureâ€™s true form vs their spell DC. If you strike a creature disguising their true form, they revert back to it.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Eater of Magic (Su)</mark>

You gain (lvl) temp hp whenever an enemy casts a spell on you.\
Gain 2 special attacks\
<mark style="color:green;">Let it Burn</mark> - On hit, mana burn 1+(1/2) lvl, or expend the use of a 1/day innate technique.\
<mark style="color:green;">Spellrend</mark> - If you land an attack against a persistent Su or Sp effect with HP, such as a wall spell or a summoned creature, you automatically deal the attack's damage to the creature that created the effect too.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Spellbane (Su)</mark>

You have trained your body to react to magic words with violence. When an enemy you threaten casts a spell, you **must** make an AoO against them. On hit the spell they cast fizzles (fort negates).\
