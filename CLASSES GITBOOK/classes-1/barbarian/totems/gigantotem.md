Become large and in charge.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Totem Feature - Embiggen</mark>

When raging, your size increases to large. At level 6 you can choose to instead become huge. At level 10 you can choose to become massive.

## Rage Powers

Numbers are level requirements

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Gigantic Impact</mark>

Whenever you take the jump action, create a shockwave affecting all creatures within your natural reach of where you land. Creatures are made clumsy 1.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Giant Steps</mark>

The ground quakes with each step you take. Whenever you take the dash or charge action, you can move through other creatures squares and your movement is \[elusive].  Creatures you move through take (5+2\*lvl) bludgeoning damage (reflex halves).

You cannot attack a creature you step on with this ability.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Juggernaut</mark>

You get a +4 bonus to athletics to break or displace things while raging. Every time you break something with athletics, you gain +1 wrath.

When you take the charge or dash action, you can make athletics checks to destroy or displace obstacles such as doors, walls and other barriers as a free action any number of times as long as you continue to succeed. If you initiate combat by doing this, the enemy is surprised.
