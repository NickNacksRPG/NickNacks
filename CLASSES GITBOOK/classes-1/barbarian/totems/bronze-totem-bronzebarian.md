# ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Totem (Bronzebarian)

An intellectual and cultured individual at heart, a bronzebarian applies a surprising amount of creativity to their techniques and fighting styles. Using the most advanced caveman strategies, bronzebarians set themselves apart from other barbarians.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Totem Feature - Brute Force</mark>

You can use your muscles to make up for your lack of intellect.  As long as you have a negative intelligence score, you add your strength to int-based skills instead of intelligence.\
You can automatically tell when a creature has a negative intelligence score just by looking at them.\
You may use intelligence-based skills while raging.

## Rage Powers

Numbers are level requirements

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Two-Handed Fist</mark>

By taking one hand and wrapping it around the opposite wrist, you figure out how to two-hand your fists.  When using unarmed strikes, the barbarian can use both hands, effectively treating it as a 2h weapon. Gain unarmed combatant as a bonus feat and increase fist base damage to d12.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Bronze Speech</mark>

You can speak with any creature that has a negative intelligence score as though sharing a common language.  He can write in this language, and it is treated as a secret language to those without a negative intelligence score.

Creatures with -3 or less intelligence, or that lack an intelligence score, have only very basic thoughts.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Run it Down</mark>

When a creature makes an AoO against you after you provoke from movement, you increase your speed by 40 that turn. This can happen infinitely. Gain resistance to damage from AoOs.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Handyman</mark>

You can use your vast pool of knowledge to make impromptu repairs by smashing, bending and slapping things. Roll an athletics check as a standard action. If you beat the DC by 5, then the item is permanently repaired. Otherwise it falls apart again after a few minutes and you are unable to attempt "repairing" it again.

Simple devices like a shovel or a tire swing only require a DC 10.\
Average devices like doors or backpacks are DC 15.\
Slightly complex devices like a toilet or a lamp are DC 20.\
Weapons and armor are DC 25.\
Complex devices like factory machinery and other large mechanical devices are DC 30.

You can attempt to fix something of a much larger scale, such as a factory on the brink of destruction, or fixing the sword of a huge giant, but the DC increases by 5.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Bronze Senses \[recharge]</mark>

You have an inexplicable sixth sense for what lies in the unknown. Before opening the door to a room, walking into a dark cave, or walking into a ghost town, you can always tell one choice piece of information from the following list...

* How many creatures of significance are within (1, several, many, innumerable)
* A vague idea of what is happening (a party, intercourse, a heinous ritual, research)
* The level of the most powerful creature within, and a random thing they like

This ability recharges after 5 minutes, and generally cannot be used at the same location multiple times without a significant change occurring.
