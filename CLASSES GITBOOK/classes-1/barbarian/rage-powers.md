# Rage Powers

Despite the name, rage powers, unless explicitly stated, do not require you to be raging to use.

## <mark style="color:green;">Skill-Based Raging</mark>

Choose a skill. You gain a +2 bonus to that skill and can use it while raging.

## <mark style="color:green;">Intimidating Glare</mark>

By spending 30ft of movement, you can make an intimidation check to demoralize a creature. If you successfully demoralize a creature that is already shaken, in addition to increasing the shaken penalty, you also frighten them for one round.\
A creature frightened in this way cannot be frightened again for 1 hour.

## <mark style="color:green;">Smasher</mark>

You can always sunder a creature to reduce their ac, even if it does not wear armor. You reduce their ac by 2 until someone administers first aid (DC=class DC)

## <mark style="color:green;">Ferocity</mark>

Gain the ferocity monster quality.

## <mark style="color:green;">Flesh Wound</mark>

When you are defeated, it only takes 1 minute for you to regain 1 hp.\

## <mark style="color:green;">Strength Surge</mark>

Once per rage, add (2+lvl) to an athletics check as an instant action.

## <mark style="color:green;">Bonk</mark>

Whenever you defeat a creature with a melee attack, they are automatically entangled as you smash them into the ground. If they regain consciousness, they must first escape before they can move. They roll athletics (class DC) as a swift action. Failure means they stay entangled.

## <mark style="color:green;">Fight On</mark>

An instance of damage must be at least higher than your level (after reduction) in order to defeat you. When this ability procs you take no damage.
