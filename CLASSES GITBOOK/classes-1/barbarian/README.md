# ðŸ’¢ Barbarian

Throw caution to the wind and run directly into the middle of the action. The barbarian specializes in drawing aggro and CCing enemies with a high emphasis on breaking poise. Their exceptionally high longevity assures that being focused is the only reliable way to take them down, and thatâ€™s exactly what barbarians want.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Martial)</mark>

You gain 1 technique points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on the unarmed or barbarism trees.

Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Rage</mark>

As an instant action, enter rage.  While raging you increase your strength by +1.

While raging you can't do anything with the \[concentration] tag or cast spells. You cannot use wis, int, cha or dex based skills aside from perception, intimidation and acrobatics.&#x20;

You can end your rage preemptively as a free action. When your rage ends (see wrath feature below), you are fatigued for 1 minute and cannot rage again until the minute passes (even if the fatigue is removed or negated).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Wrath</mark>

Your rage not only gives you strength and resilience, but further empowers you as your frustration grows. When you enter rage, you start off with (Â½ lvl) wrath, and get an additional stack of wrath every time you...

* Take damage (including poise damage, but not more than once an attack)
* Miss an attack or fail to break a creatures poise
* Fail an opposed skill check

Increase the poise damage you deal and your athletics bonus by your stacks of wrath.

You can only maintain wrath while not wearing armor and only during combat, or other minigames like arm wrestling contests and chases. You cannot accumulate/maintain wrath when you are not in such a scenario.

{% hint style="info" %}
I'm not a lawyer, so my writing is probably not without loopholes. The basic idea is to only accumulate wrath in dramatic situations. You should not be able to farm wrath by having a bunch of squires poke a barbarian for a few minutes before going into a battle.

Never let your players abuse mechanics in a way that feels like exploiting the system, especially if it soils the fun.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Multiattack</mark>

Make an attack and a combat maneuver attack.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Totem Powers</mark>

Choose a totem. You gain access to a unique feature based on the totem, and a unique set of rage powers.\
When you choose a totem power, you are locked into that totem and cannot choose from other totems.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Speed</mark>

+10 speed.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Naked Courage</mark>

You have resistance to physical damage. You ignore the effects of extreme temperatures and other similar insignificant environmental effects.  Only functions when you do not wear armor.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Rage Powers</mark>

Gain a rage power this level and levels 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Outnumbered</mark>

Creatures cannot flank you.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Stalwart</mark>

You take half damage from fortitude saves. When you pass a fort save, it deals no damage and has no additional effect.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Tantrum</mark>

Every time you take damage or poise damage from an enemy, take note of it. The 4th instance of damage you take provokes an AoO from the creature that dealt it. If you do not threaten the creature, attack a random creature within reach. If no creature is within reach, you can make a thrown attack if you have a free hand or wield a thrown weapon or increase your speed by 30 next turn.

This counter resets when you roll initiative.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Reckless Abandon</mark>

Break your body against your enemy for increased effectiveness. As a free action, gain +2 attack for 1 round, but every attack roll you make during this round deals 5 true damage to you.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Always Angry</mark>

Strength granted by rage increases from +1 to +2. You are no longer fatigued after ending rage. You can start or stop raging as a free action once per turn.
