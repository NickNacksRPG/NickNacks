## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Puppeteer \[companion] \[concentration]</mark>

You can take control of the body of a creature that gets defeated within 30 ft of you as an instant action if they are the target of your hypnotic stare, or you can redirect your stare as an immediate action if they aren't (will negates). When you take control, they gain (10+2\*lvl) temp hp and you control them as the [domination](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/shira/level-4/domination) spell until this temp hp is depleted, you no longer have line of sight to your puppet, you are unable to concentrate or 1 minute passes. The creature acts on your turn.
