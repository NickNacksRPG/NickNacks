# Psychic Implants

Effects with a number require a specific level. All of these effects have the \[contingent], \[subtle] and \[companion] tags. They are all (Su) abilities. Unlike other contingent effect, there is no visual indicator.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Suggestion</mark>

When you inflict the implant, you give the creature a simple suggestion and a trigger. Something is simple when it requires little effort, isn't dangerous and only requires a few minutes. This won't make a creature act against its ethos, but can make them do something unusual for them. "Don't lock the door on your way out. Vouge for me when I speak to the elder." Etc You can also leave the implant's suggestion blank, and make a suggestion later by verbally making it.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Innocuous Visitor</mark>

When you activate the implant, you cause the creature to not notice you and your allies while you exist nearby for 10 minutes. The creature treats your actions as normal as long as they are not violent and does not remember what you and your allies did during this time.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Witness \[scrying]</mark>

When you activate the implant, you can sense through the creature for up to 10 minutes. You see through its eyes, hear with its ears etc using all of its senses from their PoV. You are effectively stunned while you do this and can choose to redirect your senses back to your own body if you take damage or are otherwise harmed.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Mind over Matter \[healing]</mark>

When you activate the implant, the implanted creature gains 5+(your level\*3) temp hp. This forces them to push past their bodies usual limits, so it also inflicts drained 1.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Advanced Darkness \[darkness]</mark>

What you activate this implant, the creature suddenly finds themselves in a cloud of darkness that they cannot escape. This darkness lasts one minute.

Does not work against creatures with darkvision.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Imposter \[glamer]</mark>

When you activate this implant, you can choose another creature that the implanted creature can see and have them appear to transform into a more to fearsome version of themselves. They stay the same size, but you can make them appear more fiendish, undead, they grow a bunch of tentacles, etc. Their exact appearance is up to you. The transformation lasts 1 minute.

Reactions may vary from directly attacking the creature to causing a scene. No matter what though, the creature is automatically shaken 2 during the transformation.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Fake Death</mark>

When you activate this implant, you can have the creature appear to die to all others. The creature actually turns invisible, as per the spell. Creatures get a will save to disbelieve the illusory corpse when they interact with it.
