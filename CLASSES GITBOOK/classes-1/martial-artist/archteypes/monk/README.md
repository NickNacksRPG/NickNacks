# üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Monk

A monk is an unarmed fighter that chooses to not only hone their body into a perfect weapon, but also their spirit. Be it through the exploration of the self or the deprivation of worldly pleasures, these warriors unlock spiritual powers that work in tandem with their highly mobile, up close and personal fighting style.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - First Strike: Dazing Fist</mark>

Your first unarmed attack you land on a creature has a bonus effect. This effect can only be applied to a creature 1/day.\
Dazes a creature for 1 round on hit (fort negates).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Monk Vow</mark>

You have taken a vow, depriving yourself of something others might consider core to existence. Your unusual lifestyle comes with a unique benefit befitting of your dedication.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Perfect Balance</mark>

You gain the acrobatics skill, and a +4 bonus.\
You can stand on even the thinnest and weakest of surfaces without falling over and without breaking the surface. This can include flimsy bridges/branches, rope, or even wet napkins.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Meditate (Su)</mark>

Draw in the energy of the universe and steel your mind as a FRA.\
You regain (1+¬º) your level mana, remove all shaken stacks and take the total defense action.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Light Steps (Su) \[concentration]</mark>

You can start concentrating on this ability as a free action.\
As long as you only move during your turn and take no other action, you can walk along any flat continuous surface. This can include things that aren't even otherwise solid such as water or lava. It can also include things such as walls or ceilings.

You can use this ability for only part of your turn to get to a location, but if you attack, cast a spell etc, then you need a surface you would normally be able to stand on or you plummet.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Well of Wisdom</mark>

Monks have a way of thinking about the world unlike any other. By simplifying complex truths into easy to understand proverbs, you can give your allies a unique perspective.

1/day you can dispense your knowledge as a standard action to a creature within reach. When the proverb finally clicks, you give your ally a reroll on a skill check of their choosing. If they do not use it by the time they rest, the wisdom is lost.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Deep Breath</mark>

At the start of your turn if you are shaken, confused, frightened or under some type of charm/possession effect, you can choose to immediately end all of those effects as a swift action by spending 2 mana.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Healing Hand (Su) \[healing] \[overheal]</mark>

Knock bones into place and relax muscles with a quick jab. Spend 1 mana to touch a creature and heal (3+lvl) hp. Can be done as a swift and a standard action. Temp hp granted by this ability lasts 10 minutes.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Ki Block</mark>

On hit apply siphon for 1 round (fort negates).\
Alternatively you can disable a creatures limb for 1 round. Targeted wings disable flight, legs decrease speed by 15 and arms render them unusable etc (fort negates).
