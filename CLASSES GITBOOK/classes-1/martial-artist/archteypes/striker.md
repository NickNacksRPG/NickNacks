# Striker

You dribble around a ball constantly using anything but your arms, using it to accentuate your unique fighting style using it. Using all types of kicks, bumps and headbutts, you slam this ball repeatedly into your foes until they drop.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Ball is Life</mark>

You use mostly your feet to kick around a ball. You can kick it to make a thrown weapon attack \[elusive] against a creature (deals unarmed damage) and have it immediately bounce back to your feet. In order to steal your ball, a creature must somehow catch it mid-attack, or disarm you.\
If a creature ever grabs the ball with their hands/arms/opposable limb of choice, they immediately take 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) true damage, and the same damage at the end of each turn they continue to hold it.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Penalty Shot</mark>

If you do not move before attacking, you can make a ball attack at a creature within 40 ft at no penalty.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Kicking Circles</mark>

If you move through every space adjacent to a creature in a circle around them (usually provoking in the process), you feint them.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Conditioning</mark>

Gain endurance as a bonus feat.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Flurry: One-Two Punch</mark>

Flurry does not suffer a MA penalty. Only applies to one flurry attack.
