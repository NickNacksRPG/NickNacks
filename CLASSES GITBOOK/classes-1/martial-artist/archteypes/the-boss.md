# The Boss

Being the boss is all about getting into the middle of the fight, taking and dealing blows and equal measure and using their enemies as their weapons.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Flurry: One-Two Punch</mark>

Flurry does not suffer a MA penalty. Only applies to one flurry attack.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Getting Serious</mark>

While below half hp, gain FH 1 and access to haymaker.

<mark style="color:green;">Special Attack: Haymaker (Su) \[force] \[healing] \[recharge]</mark>\
Gain (10+2\*lvl) as temp hp until the start of next turn. Deal the same value in force damage in a 30-foot cone (reflex halves). You can also make a melee attack against a creature to have the cone erupt from them. On-hit the creature takes a -2 penalty to their save against haymaker.\
Can only be used 1/minute.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Send It</mark>

Whenever you provoke an AoO, get a +2 bonus to attack until the end of your turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Now Kiss</mark>

If you land an unarmed attack or break poise against two creatures that are within reach, you slam them together, stunning them for 1 turn (fort negates). If you are already grappling a creature, you only need to land an attack or poise break 1 other creature within reach. If you are grappling two creatures, this happens automatically.\
Once a creature is stunned by this ability (or negates the stun), it is immune for 1 hour.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Meat Shield</mark>

When grappling a creature, you can cause the grappled creature to be the target of an attack roll instead of you as an immediate action.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Toss Foes</mark>

You know the barbarism technique [Foe Toss](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/barbarism/level-2/foe-toss) and automatically memorize it without consuming memory.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Bossing Around</mark>

You know the magical technique [Command](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/shira/level-2/command) and automatically memorize it without consuming memory. You can use it without a staff.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Special Attack: Star KO \[recharge]</mark>

Perform an unarmed strike and uppercut your foe into the stratosphere (fort negates). While airborne, the target is considered thousands of feet away from the battlefield and is entangled. At the end of your next turn they land in the space they were launched from, taking 20 crush damage from falling and are knocked down.

If the attack defeats the foe, they are instead launched d100 miles in a random direction.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Showstopper \[recharge]</mark>

You gain the wrestling move of the same name (see [wrestling moves](wrestler/wrestling-moves.md) for more details). It can also be a [finisher](wrestler/#id-1-wrestling-moves).\
The initial target and creatures in the impact zone instead take 7d6+lvl (24+lvl) crush damage and are staggered for 1 round (fort halves damage and negates stagger).

Can only be used 1/minute.
