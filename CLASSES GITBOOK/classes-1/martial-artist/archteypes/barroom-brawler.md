# Barroom Brawler

To some, drinking isn't just a something they do at parties, its a lifestyle. Barroom Brawlers have developed an unusual fighting style that combines the unnatural movements while drunk with the pain numbing effects of alcohol to be as annoying as possible to take down.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Drinking Buddy</mark>

In a neutral scenario (aka one where you aren't actively being attacked), you can goad someone into a drinking contest with you (will negates). If you've already challenged someone, it won't work again.

If you are in a location where alcohol is sold, the DC is 2 higher.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Keg</mark>

Whether you carry it around, sling it onto your back, you have a large source of basic booze you keep with you at all times. To you it weighs nothing, but to anybody else it weighs 200 lbs full and 20 empty.

Your keg is enough to last you a week before you must return to civilization and craft a refill. With an empty keg, you cannot chug. If you spend 3 days crafting, you can fill your keg with moonshine.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Chug \[recharge] \[healing]</mark>

Take a swig to grant yourself (4+½ lvl) temp hp. You can take up to 3 drinks in one turn to increase the temp hp you gain by the same amount. You can drink as a standard action, swift action, and by spending 30 ft of movement.

Any turn you chug, you only have access to one of your hands while the other is used to shotgun your drink from the keg.

Chug has a unique form of cooldown. See tip below for more details.

{% hint style="success" %}
You must use a form of _alcohol processing_ in order to begin recharging chug, after which it is on cooldown for 1 round. A helpful way to remember if you can chug is to recall what you did last round. The sequence goes...\
chug>processing>nothing>chug etc.\
If you chugged or processed the alcohol last turn, you cannot chug this turn.
{% endhint %}

Your keg can be sundered, increasing the movement cost of drinking from it to 40 ft instead of 30 while it is damaged.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 -  Alcohol Processing</mark>

At any point the turn after using chug, you can do one of the following actions. You must do one of the following to begin recharging chug. Chug is on cooldown for 1 round after using alcohol processing.

<mark style="color:green;">Rest and Digest \[healing]</mark> - As a free action, heal equal to your remaining temp hp from chug (up to 75% max hp, any remaining after is wasted.) If you have no temp from chug remaining, you can still use this ability, but it provides no healing and only recharges chug.

<mark style="color:green;">Belch \[sonic]</mark> - As a standard action, burp in the face of a creature within reach. They take 5 sonic damage and become staggered for 1 round (fort negates stagger).

<mark style="color:green;">Vomit \[poison]</mark> - As a standard action, release the contents of your stomach onto a creature within reach. They takes (2d6+d6/odd lvl) poison damage and are sickened 1 (reflex halves dmg and negates sicken).

<mark style="color:green;">Exotic Flavor</mark> - As a free action, appreciate the fine details of an exotic beverage you've obtained via the _Taste Test_ quest. Gain its benefits until you chug again.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Seeing Double</mark>

Gain the [blind fight ](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/combat-feats/blind-fight)feat.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Quest! Taste Test</mark>

Standard booze can only get you so far. By traveling around the world and finding different types of alcohol, you can gain new bonuses from alcohol processing. These bonuses apply until you chug again.

These beverages can usually be obtained from different cultures, races or master craftsman. Some examples…

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="233"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Type</td><td>Benefit</td></tr><tr><td>Mind Bomb</td><td>+2 to intelligence skills</td></tr><tr><td>Bloody Brandy</td><td>+2 to dmg against damaged creatures</td></tr><tr><td>Gob-Gin</td><td>Your movement is [elusive]</td></tr><tr><td>Sunset Sake</td><td>Give yourself night vision</td></tr><tr><td>Seriozna Vodka</td><td>Take 1 true damage and gain cold resistance</td></tr><tr><td>Bourbon Brace</td><td>+2 to fort saves</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Staggering Fortitude \[recharge]</mark>

As an instant action, you can cause all damage you take to be delayed until the end of your next turn.

Recharges after using chug.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Poison Resistance</mark>

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Stalwart</mark>

You take half damage from fortitude saves. When you pass a fort save, it deals no damage and has no additional effect.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Improvise, Adapt, Overcome</mark>

When you use an improvised weapon, you can give yourself +2 attack, but the item breaks and becomes unusable after.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Barrel Roll \[recharge] \[elusive]</mark>

Jump onto your keg and roll around on it as a standard action. Every time you move adjacent to an enemy this turn, shove it 10 feet and gain an additional 10 speed. You cannot affect the same creature multiple times with barrel roll.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Happy Hour \[recharge]</mark>

1/day when you chug, allies within reach gain the same temp hp you do.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Woozy Fist \[elusive] \[recharge]</mark>

As an instant action, you can move 5 feet. If you use this in response to being attacked, a creature can move to follow you if they have the movement available to keep you in range, otherwise the attack automatically misses.

Recharges when you chug.

{% hint style="info" %}
This might not seem like much, but consider this.

As an instant action you can step out the AoE of effects, like a line attack. You can instantly move behind cover in response to a ranged attack. You can retreat into the warm embrace of your shield brother for protection. Instant movement in a turn-based game is better than you might initially suspect!
{% endhint %}



## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Drinking Problem</mark>

Chug no longer requires alcohol processing in order to recharge, allowing you to use it every other turn.

Basically all you ask yourself is "did I chug last turn?" If you did, no chug. If you didn't, chug away!
