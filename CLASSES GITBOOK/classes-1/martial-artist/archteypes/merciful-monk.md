# Merciful Monk

Merciful monks have transcended the need to deal any damage at all, optimizing their fighting style to turn an enemies force against them and aid allies who are in danger.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - First Strike: Pacify</mark>

Your first unarmed attack you land on a creature has a bonus effect. This effect can only be applied to a creature 1/day.\
Pacifies a creature for 1 round on hit.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Monk Vow: Vow of Mercy</mark>

You have taken a vow to never directly harm another creature. You cannot deal damage with attacks, spells, items etc (or effects that cause similar results like inflicting drained). You can still make attacks in order to inflict other effects (see fighting styles).

Your unique approach to life gives you a +2 bonus to attack, the persuasion skill and a +4 bonus to persuasion.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Ki (Su)</mark>

Gain a (3+lvl) additional mana reserves. All abilities marked with Ki cost 1 mana.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Disturb the Balance</mark>

You can parry without a buckler. When you successfully parry, you can make a bully attack against the foe that attacked you, as long as they are within 30 ft of you.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Ki: Life Link (Su)</mark>

This ability has a different effect depending on if you target an enemy or an ally. You can only tether one creature at a time.\
<mark style="color:green;">Enemy</mark> - A visible tether appears between you and a target within 30 ft, bonding you together for 3 rounds (will negates). As long as this creature is within 60 ft of you, any damage that it deals to creatures that aren't you is halved and the creature takes half the damage. If the creature gets more than 60 ft away from you, the effect ends.\
<mark style="color:green;">Ally \[bond] \[mana burn]</mark> - A visible tether appears between you and a willing ally within 30 ft, bonding you together indefinitely. As long as this creature is within 100 ft of you, it gains 15 speed. Other allies that pass through the tether gain an additional 15 speed for 1 round. This tethers bonus can be inflicted on creatures by moving around them and having the tether pass through them.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Redirect Force</mark>

When an attack misses or grazes you and there is another creatures threatening you, you can redirect the attack to any other creature that threatens you as an immediate action, automatically hitting.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Ki: Your Skills Are Inferior (Su)</mark>

As a standard action, taunt an enemy. If they land an attack against you or break your poise, the taunt ends.\
If successful, you can parry as part of the same action by spending an additional 1 mana.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Ki: Safeguard (Su) \[elusive] \[healing] \[recharge]</mark>

As a swift action, you can dash up to 30 feet to appear adjacent to an ally. You grant yourself and your ally 10 temp hp.  You restore 10 poise for you and your ally.

You can parry attacks directed at your safeguarded ally until the start of your next turn, provided they stay within reach.\
This ability cannot be used in successive turns.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Pressure Points (Su)</mark>

Whenever you land an unarmed attack against a creature, it takes a stacking -1 penalty to attack.
