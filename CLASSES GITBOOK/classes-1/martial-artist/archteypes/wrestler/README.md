# Wrestler

Wrestlers specialize in grappling their foes and doing with them as they please: pinning them to the ground, tossing them into the air and bending them into pretzels.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Grapplemancer</mark>

Gain the [maneuver initiate](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/combat-feats/maneuver-initiate) feat. Gain the [tangled](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/combat-feats/maneuver-initiate/tangled) feat. The tangled feat's bonuses last until the start of your turn whenever you succeed on a grapple, regardless of if you maintain the grapple.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Wrestling Moves</mark>

Wrestlers are defined by their unique moves, centered around grappling. Wrestling moves involve you initiating a grapple, and then immediately ending it in order to gain a bonus effect and deal your unarmed damage, unless otherwise noted. All wrestling moves are special attacks that have a global cooldown, preventing them from being used multiple times in one turn and on subsequent turns (use 1 turn, don’t use next turn).

If the target is knocked down, staggered or cannot take actions as a result of some other cc, the wrestling move is considered a finisher, increasing its DC by 2.

Gain 2, then an additional one at level 4, 6, 8 and 10. See subsection for selection.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Crowd Favorite</mark>

Whenever a combat you take part in has spectators, enough to be considered a "crowd," you gain a single reroll for that combat.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Tap Out</mark>

If a wrestler successfully grapples a creature for three turns (sequence being initiate turn one, maintain turn 2, tap out turn 3), he can force the creature to tap out or be knocked out. If the creature refuses to tap out, they are instantly knocked unconscious, drop to 0 hp and are drained 2.  Creatures that tap out receive the time out condition for 24 hours.

If you can initiate a grapple outside of your turn, you must still take 3 full turns to force someone to tap out.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Flex</mark>

By spending an immediate action to pose and flex, you can increase your next strength-based skill check by 4.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - From the Top Ropes</mark>

Whenever the wrestler initiates a wrestling move from a position where he jumps down onto his foe at least 10 feet, he treats the move as a finisher and he does not take fall damage. The wrestler cannot use flight or a high jump height to count as “jumping down” onto his foe.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Signature Move</mark>

Give one of your wrestling moves a special name. It's DC increases by 2.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Countermeasures</mark>

When a creature fails to break your poise with a combat maneuver, you can bully them as an instant action as long as it was with a melee attack.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - The Wall</mark>

You cannot be unwillingly moved from your space. If the attack had other effects, they still apply.
