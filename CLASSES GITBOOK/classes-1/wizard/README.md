# ðŸ§™ Wizard

If there are any mortals that can be considered masters of magic, it can be wizards. Each one a prodigy in their own right, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with mana. Wizards are on the cutting edge of new magical items, rituals and spells, creating new ones and enhancing old classics to fit their particular approach to magic.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Magical)</mark>

You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another 2 points every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on any magical technique tree.

Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Cutting Edge</mark>

Choose a magical technique tree. This tree is the field of magic you specialize in. You get a +8 bonus to arcana when dealing with spells of this school. You gain a technique point in this tree, and an additional technique point each odd level, all must be dedicated to this specific technique tree.

Every time you gain a technique point in this tree, you can make some magic happen. You can choose one of 3 paths, depending on how much effort you are willing to put forth...

1. You can create your own completely original spell for this spell school. This can be a bit of a daunting task, requiring a degree of trust between game master and player. Once a spell is created, the balancing does not stop there, and should be adjusted as needed to not disrupt the game _too_ much.
2. Alter an existing spell. Have you ever looked at a spell and wished it was just a little bit different? Perhaps you wanted a _boneless_ [boneshaker](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/necromancy/level-1/bone-shaker) spell, or a snow woman instead of a [snow man](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/cryomancy/level-1/snow-man). These changes are encouraged to alter not only the flavor text, but also the mechanics. Perhaps our boneless-shaker allows you to create the boneless world you desire, tearing out a creatures skeleton leaving them a clumsy blob person. Perhaps a snow woman is more affectionate preferring to get up close and personal, grabbing creatures and keeping them frosty.\
   In any case, the power of the altered spell should be pretty close to the original, and should serve a similar type of purpose.\
   You could also choose to upgrade a lower level spell. Say you thought [fireblast ](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/pyromancy/level-3/fire-blast)wasn't explosive enough. Make a 5th level version that explodes again at the end of your next turn, forcing creatures who failed the initial save to eat another one without some extra speed or aid from allies.
3. If you aren't confident in your ability, or just don't have the time. Gain +1 memory.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Skill</mark>

You are proficient in the arcana skill with a +4 bonus.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Neuroplasticity</mark>

You can choose to leave up to 3 of your memory slots unused. By spending 1 minute, you can choose to prepare a spell in that unused memory slot.

If you \[mana burn] 1, you can fill an empty slot as a free action.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Familiar</mark>

Choose a level 0 fiend, celestial or fey, or create a beast that is automatically tiny using the Beast Trainer's Beast Companion feature. It's level is always 0. If it aids you in combat, it gains the \[companion] tag. You can also use your familiar to do a handful of other useful things.

<mark style="color:green;">Spying \[scrying]</mark> - You can sense through your companion at will. See the [scrying tag](https://app.gitbook.com/s/1UhIURz1UgUHbhhsNrtV/the-rules/publish-your-docs-7) for more details.\
<mark style="color:green;">Assistant</mark> - Your companion can use the aid action to assist you for any skill checks.\
<mark style="color:green;">To My Side \[teleportation]</mark> - You can concentrate for 3 rounds to teleport your companion to your side.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Mana Wells</mark>

Your mana pool is deeper than most. Add 1 to your mana pool at this level, and levels 4, 6, 8 and 10.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Arcane Discovery</mark>

The remainder of this class is full of <mark style="color:green;">arcane discoveries.</mark> These features are customizable abilities that you gain at level 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Each archetype comes with its own.
