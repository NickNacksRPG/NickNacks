# Financial

Financial wizards look to win battles far before they are ever fought using an enormous amount of preparation

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Silver Spoon</mark>

You have an additional contact in the financial wizard's guild. This could be a teacher, banker or parent with connections or that works for it.\
You start play with an additional 1,000g worth of mundane items. Whenever you sell items, you automatically get 60% of the items value instead of 50%.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Money is Power (Su)</mark>

The more decorated you are in your wealth, the more powerful you become. As long as you are covered in jewelry, fine clothing and other fancy mundane items worth at least (your level\*1,000g), your CL is increased by 1.

Whenever you take damage, you can choose to destroy (your level\*1000g) worth of items in order to negate it as an immediate action. Gold pieces themselves cannot be destroyed using this.

## <mark style="color:green;">Arcane Discoveries (Financial Wizardry)</mark>

Unless otherwise stated, arcane discoveries for destruction wizards only function on <mark style="color:red;">spells that deal damage.</mark>

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Arcane Synergy</mark>

Whenever you would gain any kind of bonus to arcana checks outside of this class, such as from the aid action, or a bonus from the facilities at your disposal, you increase that bonus by +2 for each unique source. A unique source means something that is different from the previous ones. For example, your two financial wizard brothers would not be different sources. Those same two brothers and a dragon are 2 sources. 2 brothers, a dragon and a laboratory are 3 sources.

Basically there needs to be a _variety_ of sources of inspiration for arcane synergy to function. Each individual can still lend aid, giving a bonus depending on their proficiency. In that same example, your two brothers would collectively give a +6 bonus (2 proficient+2 proficient+2 synergy). The dragon, less versed in magic, lacks the arcana skill and gives a +3 bonus. The lab you are doing research in normally gives +2, but with synergy gives +4. So your bonus changes from +7 to +13 thanks to arcane synergy with this setup.
