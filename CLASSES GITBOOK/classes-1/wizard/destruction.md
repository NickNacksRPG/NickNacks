# Destruction

Destruction wizards look to win battles by unleashing enormous amounts of damage, usually to large groups of foes.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - With 2 Hands!</mark>

While wielding a spell focus in each hand, you increase your CL by an additional 1 for <mark style="color:red;">spells that deal damage</mark>. This increases to 2 for spells of your school specialization.

## <mark style="color:green;">Arcane Discoveries (destruction)</mark>

Unless otherwise stated, arcane discoveries for destruction wizards only function on <mark style="color:red;">spells that deal damage.</mark>

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Artillery Mage</mark>

You can spend mana to increase the range of a spell you cast. For each point of mana you spend, you can increase the spells range by 10.&#x20;

Spells with a range of reach gain (reach+10\*mana spent) range. If the spell is an attack, it turns into a ranged attack.

Does not function for spells without a listed range.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Precision Strike</mark>

Whenever you cast a spell that has a listed AoE, your allies within that AoE are not targeted by the negative effects of the spell.

Woe to the destruction wizard who believes himself he has outwitted [Frogg Saran](https://app.gitbook.com/s/qFzTamwcoNEgFoEbLz7c/gods/earthly-deities/frogg-saran) by evading the many aspects of his spells that backfire. You can still use the techniques, but casting a Frogg spell demands unforeseen consequences. If you do not play along, you will make him your enemy.
