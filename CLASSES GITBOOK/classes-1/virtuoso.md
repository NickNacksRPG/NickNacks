# Virtuoso

Death should never be quick. It should be an opera. The virtuoso is a creature of cadence and cruelty. All of their abilities are as flashy as they are deadly. They primarily focus on dealing damage from range using a special type of firearm. Anybody familiar with a virtuoso fears the power behind the fourth shot of this gun.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Mixed)</mark>

You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another 2 point every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on the scoundrel, moogen and marksman trees.

Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique.\

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Cadence (Su)</mark>

You can transform a single standard pistol into a special weapon just by holding it in your hands.

* You need to reload it after making 4 shots instead of 1
* You can only fire once per round, making you incompatible with some multi-shot abilities (such as [snap shot](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/combat-feats/point-blank-master/snap-shot)), but you get +2 to attack when you attack using this gun.
* Bullets fired out of combat do not consume ammo.
* The 4th shot gets +10 to attack and deals 2x damage on a crit instead of 1.5x.
* Reloading always requires a standard action.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Climax</mark>

When you crit, gain +2 ac, 20 speed and \[elusive] movement until the end of your next turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Flowering Trap (Su)</mark>

As a swift action, place a trap in an unoccupied space that quickly camouflages with the surrounding terrain and blends into the terrain (DC 20+lvl perception to notice). If an enemy steps on a trapped space, it blossoms. Blossomed traps create an area of brightly lit difficult terrain in a 5 ft radius around its space until the end of the triggering creatures turn. At the end of the turn of the triggering creature, it explodes, dealing (2d6+d6/odd lvl) pierce damage to the area made into difficult terrain.

You can have 2 traps out at once at any given time. If you place another while 2 are out, one of your choosing disappears. You are mentally alerted when a trap is triggered, and which one. You gain +4 perception against any creature that has triggered a trap since you last rested.

Whenever you defeat a creature, it automatically triggers a flowering trap beneath them that explodes at the start of your next turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Spotlight (Su) \[light]</mark>

By spending 1 mana as swift action, you can target a creature within 60 ft to have a spotlight focus on for 1 minute. The light around the spotlight artificially dims for dramatic effect (but no mechanical effect). That creature takes a -10 penalty on stealth and is brightly illuminated. The creature also has advantage on perform checks.

While a spotlight is active, you can increase the volume of your voice to echo over even large crowds.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Behind the Mask (Su)</mark>

You have an alternate ego that forms while masked, with its own name. Magical means to detect things treat you as two different creatures (such as red hand of the killer). If a creature takes off your mask, you can spend 1 mana as an instant action to cause the mask they remove to be a temporary copy that lasts 1 minute, revealing another mask underneath.

+2 to disguise while masked. While your face is obscured, such as with a mask or in darkness, you can make your voice sound like anyone you have heard.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Finale</mark>

You gain a unique special attack.\
Finale - Deal an additional 1 damage with a pistol attack. If this ends the combat, permanently increase the damage of finale by 1. If it does not end the combat, decrease the damage of finale by 1 (minimum 1).

You cannot stack finale in mock combats, training, or passively during down time hunting wolves etc.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Deadly Flourish (Su)</mark>

By spending 2 mana as swift action, you can target a 60 ft line. The very first enemy within this line is entangled for 1 round (reflex negates). If a flowering trap you can see is triggered, you can activate this as an immediate action against a creature within the radius of the blossoming trap.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - The Crowd Goes Wild! (Sp)</mark>

You can innately cast the [Ghost Sound](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/cantrips/ghost-sound) cantrip as a free action, but only to make the sounds typical of an audience, such as clapping, laughter, gasping etc.

You can cast this as an instant action when you successfully end a combat with finale.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Armor Penetration</mark>

You can perform sunder maneuvers through your pistol without penalty, but only to break armor and shields. 4th shots require no roll and automatically succeed.

## <mark style="color:green;">3 - Perfect Execution</mark>

When you kill a creature with your pistol, you can choreograph how their blood splatters. You can cause it to form a pool of a specific shape, with enough precision to write in text, but usually no more than 2 sentences. You can also cause it to make patterns on the deceased's skin.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Curtains Close (Su)</mark>

When you defeat a creature, you can spend 2 mana as an instant action to cause a pair of curtains to appear and close in between you and your victim directly adjacent to you. These curtains are 20 ft tall and 20 ft wide. It lasts for 1 minute, or until they are opened.

You can open the curtains as a free action from any distance, and an enemy can open the curtains as a standard action if they are adjacent. It is not difficult for any creature to simply move past the curtains by going through or under without opening them.

## <mark style="color:green;">5 - Eulogy (Su)</mark>

When you kill someone, you can write a eulogy for them, provided you have the means to physically write one. You can drop this eulogy off on the corpse, the creature's previous home or simply a nearby settlement. This eulogy naturally multiplies, finding itself in newspaper stands, cafes, waiting rooms etc. The less important the creature, the less it spreads. This results in the eulogy being pretty common knowledge for well known people, and the talk of the town for beloved or reviled creatures.

You can choose to write or draw anything on this eulogy, but cannot attach any kind of magical spells/traps to it. It must be concise enough to fit on a single standard page.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Red Carpet (Su)</mark>

By spending 1 mana as a free action, you can roll out the red carpet for 1 minute. This carpet is 10 ft wide and 60 ft long. It must be placed on a mostly flat, though not necessarily solid, surface. It can also be placed on any surface where carpet is commonly found (such as a staircase). It can be placed on the surface of still(ish) water. It can be used as a bridge to cross a chasm, provided the gap is mostly level.

While walking on this carpet, creatures ignore difficult terrain. If you make another carpet, the previous one disappears.

## <mark style="color:green;">7 - Theater of the Mind (Su) \[mind-affecting]</mark>

You can extend your hand towards a creature and offer to show them the world (or something to that effect). If they willingly take your hand, they are automatically fascinated for up to 5 minutes. During this time you completely obscure their senses from the outside world and take them on a magical journey of your imagining with catchy songs and pretty visuals straight out of a Disney movie.

To the outside world it merely looks like you are holding hands with the creature. You can even decide to move the creature around as though you were going for a walk, or dancing at a party. If you move more than 60 ft away from the creatures location, then the fascination ends.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Bouncing Grenade</mark>

By spending 2 mana as a swift action, drop a peculiar grenade on a creature within 30 ft of you that deals 4d6 (14) crush damage to it and then bounces up to 10 ft to a target of your choosing, dealing this damage again. \
If it defeats the enemy, you can choose another creature within 30 ft for it to bounce to and its damage increases by 2d6 (7).\
The grenade can hit a maximum of 4 creatures.

## <mark style="color:green;">9 - Last Whisper</mark>

When you kill a creature, you see their life flash before your eyes, learning one piece of information.

* Greatest regret
* Deepest secret
* Closest companion

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Curtain Call \[recharge]</mark>

Choose a direction and reduce your speed to 0 at the start of your turn. Until you move or are poise broken you can only shoot in that direction (180 degrees), but you can increase your range to 200. Once you shoot a 4th shot, this effect ends.
