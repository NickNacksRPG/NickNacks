# Necromancer

A necromancer's primary power is the ability to give new life to corpses, adding them to their squad of undead minions. Their favorite spells aid their minions, use them as ammunition or simply kill creatures. Their other abilities aid them in gathering information through their undead or dead creatures. Some necromancers choose to sit back and let their minions do the work, and others lead them into battle.
