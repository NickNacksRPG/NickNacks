## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Disciple of Death</mark>

Shortened to DoD. Gain a pool of (4+2\*lvl) to use for many of your class abilities. All abilities marked DoD cost 1 point.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - DoD: Drain Hope \[recharge] \[healing] \[necrotic] \[overheal]</mark>

As a swift action, make a ranged attack as though using a thrown weapon. On-hit apply a tether linking you and the target creature. At the end of your turn it takes 2d6+CL (7+CL) necrotic damage and you heal an equal amount. This tether lasts 3 up to 3 rounds. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from you, the tether breaks.

When you miss, or when the tether breaks, this ability cannot be used again on your next 3 turns.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Death Defied (Su) \[recharge]</mark>

When you are defeated, you can instead choose not to be. Your body vanishes and transforms into an incorporeal and invincible spirit version of yourself, cleansing all non-permanent status. While in this form you can continue to float around the battlefield with a 30ft hover speed. At the end of your 4rd turn defying death, you return to life at 50% of your max hp.

While in this form you can move and speak, but you can only take 2 actions: melee attack, or drain hope. They have unique effects while defying death. Melee attacks reduce a creatures speed by 15 on hit, but deal no damage. Drain hope immediately recharges, and has its resource cost removed. It does not deal damage or heal you, but for each round you drain, you return to life 1 turn sooner.

After you use death defied, you acquire a unique T3 affliction.

<mark style="color:green;">Hades' Watchful Eye</mark> - You cannot use death defied.

<mark style="color:green;">Cure</mark> - You must pay your respects to the god of death. This requires performing a 1 week ritual in a place of worship dedicated to Hades, or spending 1 week tidying up places where the dead are kept.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Bonk</mark>

The first time you land a melee attack each round, gain a stack. When you have 2 stacks, you get access to a unique special attack.

<mark style="color:green;">Special Attack: Bonk</mark> - Get a +10 bonus to attack. All creatures within 10 ft of the original target also take the attacks dmg. If no creatures are within 10 ft of the original target, deal an additional d6/odd lvl dmg.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - DoD: Wraith Walk (Su) \[teleportation]</mark>

You can let your spirit temporarily leave your body as a standard action. When you do, you immediately dash and become an invincible incorporeal spirit, similar to death defied. Your body remains in the position you used this ability from.

At the end of your turn, your body teleports to the position of your spirit.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - DoD: Children of the Grave (Su) \[curse] \[companion]</mark>

You can apply a curse to an enemy as a swift action. The curse has no effect until the creature is defeated or killed. When such condition is filled, its spirit briefly leaves its body and fights by your side. The spirit uses all of the creatures stats, but it can only use its multiattack, or make a single simple attack if it has none.

It spawns with only 50% of its max hp and disappears after 1 minute. The spirit persists even if the creature recovers from the defeated condition or death. A spirit can only spawn from a creature once each day.

If you are not present when the spirit is summoned, you receive a mental alert and can immediately begin \[scrying] and control the spirit. If you already have 2 companion slots filled because of your undead, one is put in stasis until the spirit leaves. If you already have 2 companion slots from other sources, ~~play another class~~ this feature doesn't work.

The curse is removed by touching a gravestone and saying "F."

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Improved Wraith Walk</mark>

You can use wraith walk as a swift action, and can maintain wraith form for up to 3 turns. When you move directly through a creature, it becomes sickened 2 (fort negates).

## <mark style="color:green;">11 -</mark>&#x20;
