# Suitor

Suitors wear their mech like it was a fancy suit of armor.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Suit Basics</mark>

Your mech is essentially a piece of full body armor shaped like you that you must enter to operate. It is form fitting and is operated by you physically moving your limbs. Once you put it on, you can activate it and deactivate it as an instant action 1/turn, causing it to either disappear or reappear. While it is deactivated, it leaves behind large, distinct tattoos that look like wires, power sources or something similar behind.

Usually because of this feature, there isn't much reason to get out of the mech outside of repairs.\
In order for another creature to use your mech, they must roll a DC (20+your engineering bonus) to use it. Otherwise it is a very fancy hunk of metal to them.

Because your mech is a suit of armor, you can decide what type of armor it mimics (light, medium, heavy), provided you have the required strength.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Handy</mark>

Many offensive suit augments require hands to utilize. Unlike a pilot who can get a more complex control scheme to activate additional limbs, you cannot use extra limbs to control the additional augments. If you take more than 2 hand augments, then you need to swap between them as a standard action. You can also remove hand augments as a standard action to allow fine hand manipulation. Hands consumed by augments can be used to hold/grab things, but cannot wield weapons/shields or perform fine manipulation \
Ex. You can drag an ally to safety but you can't feed them a potion. You can open a door, but you cant lockpick it.
