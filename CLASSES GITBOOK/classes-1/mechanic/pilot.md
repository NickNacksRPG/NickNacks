# Pilot

Pilots hop into their mechs and drive them around.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Mech Basics</mark>

Mechs must be one size category larger than you to use. In order for another creature to use your mech, they must roll a DC (20+your engineering bonus) to use it. Otherwise it is a very fancy hunk of metal to them.

You are effectively treated as mounted on your mech while driving it. Any damage it takes depletes your hp and any effects targeting the mech target you (such as charming gaze). Any attacks it makes use your stats, etc. It is not a separate creature, but an extension of yourself. The only exception to this is you use the AC value of your mech while mounted in it.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Emergency Exit</mark>

At any point, you can eject from your mech as an instant action and appear in its space. Remounting requires a swift action, but cant be done in the same turn you exit. Emergency exit needs to be manually recharged as a standard action while mounted to use again.
