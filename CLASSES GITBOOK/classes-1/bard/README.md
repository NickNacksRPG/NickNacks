# Bard

Carry your party, your town, or perhaps even the whole world with inspiring tunes. Bards excel when in the middle of their team jamming away to buff their allies and bother their enemies. They also excel at manipulating others, some through clever wordplay or song, and others through magic.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Magical)</mark>

You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on the shroomlette, moogen or shira trees.

Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and cantrips.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Magic Musician (Su)</mark>

You get proficiency in the profession (musician) skill and a +4 bonus to all related checks. You can use this profession skill to make history checks. When you make a history check using profession, you need to spend 1 minute to sing the song while playing an instrument to jog your memory.

You can make these checks and generate music without an instrument by making the required movements, but you take a -4 penalty. Doing so always takes at least one hand to perform.

You can use instruments as the staff component to your spell casting, but you cannot use imaginary instruments.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Greatest Hits \[companion]</mark>

With a week of downtime, you can create a new song and spread it across the land. The take away of a song can usually boil down to into a single phrase such as "the forest houses a dangerous witch" or "Ragnar the Red has been slain." Most messages tend to catch on quickly, unless they directly oppose common sentiments or are outright lies: The aforementioned examples wouldnâ€™t work well if the witch is friendly or Ragnar is still kicking.

The overall effect of the song is to affect the general sentiment towards specific topics or to diffuse basic information. For example, you could spread heroic tales of your adventure to let people know a deadly beast is dead. A dangerous cult could be lurking in a city and you warn the people to avoid people with a specific symbol on them.

When you replace songs using your companion slots, they might not be the talk of the town anymore, being regularly performed on the streets, but they might not be forgotten. If you do a large scale organized event in the area where your song is a hit, you can make one last perform check to see if it sticks for good. See below for DCs.

The distance this song spreads is dependent on your level.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Bardic Performance (Su) \[recharge]</mark>

As a swift action, play an instrument to start a performance for 1 minute. After the minute passes or after using a finale, you cannot activate bardic performance again for 1 minute.

Performances affect all creatures within 30 ft of you, specifying either allies or enemies. You can change the type of performance that you're doing as a swift action. A creature that steps within the radius of a performance, gains its benefit/penalties for one round, even if it only exists in it briefly.

As a standard action, you can immediately end your performance to perform some kind of powerful action called a finale. Any allies that are within the area of your bardic performance before you perform your finale still gain its benefit for that round.

The types of performances and finales a bard has is based on archetype.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Countercharm \[charm]</mark>

When you succeed on a save against a charm effect, the creature who inflicted it is charmed by you for the effects usual duration.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Inspiration \[mana burn]</mark>

By burning 1 mana as an immediate action, you can allow a creature within 30 ft to add d4 to a d20 roll (minus luck checks).\
@6 increase to d6\
@11 increase to d8

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - High Note</mark>

As a swift action, increase the effectiveness of bardic performance for 1 round.\
If it targets allies, double the numerical bonuses of a bardic performance.\
If it targets enemies, increase the DC by 2.

Usable once per performance.
