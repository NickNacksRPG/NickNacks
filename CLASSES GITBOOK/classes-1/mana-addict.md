# ðŸ’Ž Mana Addict

A mana addict is an antimage who is well and truly addicted to the power of mana flowing through them. They get various abilities that function differently depending on how much mana they have.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Martial)</mark>

You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another 2 points every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on the Arc and Pupper trees.

Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Mana Wells</mark>

You have a mana pool vaster than even that of most practiced mages. You gain an additional point of mana this level and every even level after.

All your points of mana reserves are instead converted into maximum mana, unless they are tied to specific items.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Mana Barrier \[healing] \[force]</mark>

You can manifest a shimmering barrier of volatile energy that protects you and snaps at those who disturb it.

As a standard action, you can grant yourself temp hp equal to your current mana. Keep note of this value. Whenever a creature deals HP damage to you, they also take this value as force damage, regardless of how much of the temp hp you actually have left.

Mana barrier lasts indefinitely. Anything that decreases the temp hp you gain when you initially use this ability, like bone chill, also reduces the counterattack damage.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Manamateurs \[upcast]</mark>

Whenever you take damage, you can spend mana as an immediate action to reduce the damage. You can spend 1 mana to reduce the damage of an effect on you by 3. If you decrease the damage of an effect to zero, it still activates the force damage counterattack from _Mana Barrier._

<mark style="color:green;">Upcast</mark> - For each additional mana spent, reduce the damage you take from an effect by 3.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Innate Casting</mark>

You can innately cast the [Mana Ramping](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/cantrips/mana-ramping) cantrip.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Taste the Mana</mark>

Whenever you inflict mana burn, you restore 1 mana.

You can also use the mana burn you inflict on another creature to cure your own, but you are drained 1 for every 2 mana burn you cure.

As a standard action, you can cause an adjacent defeated, asleep or otherwise helpless creature to mana burn 2.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Skill</mark>

Gain arcana as a bonus skill with a +4 bonus.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Babble</mark>

You can spend 1 mana to speak the magic words of similar spells while another creature casts a spell to confuse them while they cast (will negates). This functions as the [Tongue Twister](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/shira/level-2/tongue-twister) technique with a few key differences: You can only use this as an immediate action to a creature casting a spell. If the creature fails its save, it only suffers the effects of tongue twister for the spell it is casting. If it has already spent any actions that tongue twister would normally consume, they are instead staggered until the end of their next turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Mania</mark>

While at or above half mana, you have a +10 bonus to your speed, advantage on perception checks and immunity to fatigue.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Depression</mark>

While below half mana, but not out of mana, you gain the following special attack usable an unlimited number of times per combat.\
<mark style="color:orange;">Special Attack: Mana Leech</mark> - On hit, steal (Â½ lvl) mana from the target. If the creature does not prepare techniques, also expend the use of a random 1/day innate technique they have.

When you are completely out of mana, you become fatigued, but you gain resistance to damage that originates from an effect than can be dispelled (ie Su/Sp effects). You recover 1 mana at the start of your turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Backlash</mark>

You gain [Psionic Backlash](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/arc/level-2/psionic-backlash) as an at-will innate technique. When you use it, the creature is mana burned 2 (will halves). If the creature does not prepare techniques, they also expend the use of a random 1/day innate technique they have.
