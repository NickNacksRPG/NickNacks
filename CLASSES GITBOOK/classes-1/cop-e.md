When you are defeated, you can instead feign injury. To all others it looks like you have been defeated, but you do not gain the defeated condition until the end of your next turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - First Blood</mark>

You get a +2 bonus to initiative. Your first attack each combat has advantage. If you are surprised, or if ANY other creature takes damage before you can attack, you lose the advantage on first attack.
