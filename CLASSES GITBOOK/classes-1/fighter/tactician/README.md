# Tactician

The more well informed a tactician is about a battle, the better they perform. The longer a battle goes on, the greater an edge they have by analyzing their opponent's moves.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Commander</mark>

As a standard action, give an ally with 30 ft a command. They make a simple attack.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Study Techniques</mark>

The first time you miss with an attack in a combat, allies get a +2 to attack when attacking with your commander feature for the rest of the combat. If they miss with their attack, the bonus of the next command increases to +4 for the rest of combat. This bonus can increase by 2 indefinitely.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - All Planned</mark>

You can make flashbacks. See subsection for details.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Secret Techniques</mark>

You can use any kind of special attack on the equipment page with shields.\
This ability cannot be used in consecutive rounds.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Tactical Reposition \[elusive]</mark>

As a swift action, give an ally additional movement. This movement can be used only while being threatened. The creature must end this movement in a space threatened by at least 1 creature that was originally threatening it.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Hard Read \[recharge]</mark>

As a swift action, predict what a creature within 60 feet of you will do on its next turn with its standard action.\
If you predict the creature will attack, you must predict who it will attack.\
If you predict the creature will cast a spell, you must predict what the spell will target.\
If you predict the creature will use a Su ability, you must predict what the ability will target.\
This is not an exhaustive list, but a prediction requires a high degree of specificity.

If you predict correctly and the creature performs the action you anticipated, increase your study techniques bonus by 2.\
Recharge 1 minute.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Build a Wall</mark>

Enemies treat squares within your natural reach as difficult terrain.

When you use the tank up feature of a tower shield, it doesn't lower your speed on subsequent turns when you advance forward.
