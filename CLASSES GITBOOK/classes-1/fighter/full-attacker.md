# Full Attacker

Feeling nostalgic about 3e, 3.5e or PF1e? Well here's me doing my best to recreate that experience in a slightly less heavy handed way than BB fighter. The fightiest guy is all about gaining insane amounts of movement speed and then using that speed to gain more actions. Woe to those who dare to stand in your face.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Who's Next?</mark>

If you defeat an enemy and don't have enough speed to reach a new enemy, you can move until you threaten the next closest enemy, unless your speed is 5 or less.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Full Attack</mark>

You can make an additional <mark style="color:orange;">MELEE</mark> superior attack a turn by sacrificing 30 speed once per turn. At level 4 and 8, you can do so twice and thrice per turn respectively (potentially meaning 3 bonus superior attacks by sacrificing 90 speed).

{% hint style="danger" %}
You cannot use techniques or special attacks after <mark style="color:red;">full attacking</mark>. If you use a special attack or technique during your turn, you cannot <mark style="color:red;">full attack.</mark>
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Fervor of Battle!</mark>

During combat, your speed increases by 30 this level and another 5 every level after. You must always end your movement threatening an enemy. If you ever end your turn not threatening any enemy for any reason, you become clumsy 1.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Talents</mark>

Gain one of the following abilities at level 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Each one can be used in place of a superior attack and they all share a global cooldown, only able to be used 1/round.

You cannot sacrifice superior attacks gained from _baby slayer_ to use these abilities.

<mark style="color:green;">5 Steps Ahead \[elusive]</mark> - Prepare for an incoming attack. While preparing you can trigger this ability as an immediate action, moving up to 30 feet to the opposite side of a creature that affects you with a harmful effect. You get a +4 bonus to AC and saves against this effect.

<mark style="color:green;">Random Bullshit Go</mark> - Throw a consumable item or something that is not designed to be thrown. A consumable item could be an alchemists fire, or troll oil. If it is a helpful item then it has its normal effect as if it were consumed or applied (assuming it can be done as a standard action or less). Something not designed to be thrown could be an improvised weapon, like a chair, or you could throw a cannon firing at an allied ship overboard.

<mark style="color:green;">Action Surge</mark> - You can disengage, jump, aid, focus or make a combat maneuver.

<mark style="color:green;">Brute Force</mark> - Roll an athletics check to move or break something.

<mark style="color:green;">Impossible Advance (Su)</mark> -&#x20;
