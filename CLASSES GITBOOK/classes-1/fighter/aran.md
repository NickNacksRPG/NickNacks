## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Smash Swing</mark>

Gain [weapon focus (slash)](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/combat-feats/weapon-focus) as a bonus feat. You cab use great cleave at will. When you cleave, it is referred to as <mark style="color:red;">Smash Swing.</mark>

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Combat Step \[elusive]</mark>

If you defeat at least one enemy during Smash Swing, you may activate Combat Step as a swift action to move an additional 10 feet without spending your movement.

Cleave normally requires you stand still to attack all foes in range, but movement using combat step ignores this, allowing you to continue your cleave as you step through combat. You still can't continue the endless cleave with your normal movement.

At level 6, Combat Step is always a free action.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Combo</mark>

After defeating an enemy with a melee attack, you get another Superior Attack that must be used before the end of your turn (doesn't work off-turn).

Whenever you defeat another creature past the first in a round, get you an additional Combat Step that can be used as a free action.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Hoard Breaker</mark>

You can attack all group-type enemies normally and without penalty, and deal double damage to them.

In addition, you cannot be flanked.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Combo Drain \[healing]</mark>

Defeating an enemy heals 3 hp.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Aero Swing</mark>

If you Smash Swing while in the air, you may spend all of your remaining movement to hover in place until the start of your next turn. You may use this to fly using your Combat Steps, should you defeat enemies in the air.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Smashing</mark>

You push your combat prowess to its absolute maximum in the heat of a combo. Superior Attacks deal maximum damage to opponents you struck with Smash Swing on the same turn.
