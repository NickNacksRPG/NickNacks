# Flying Blade

A slightly more supernatural eccentric fighter whose primary gimmick is flight.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Who's Next?</mark>

If you defeat an enemy and don't have enough speed to reach a new enemy, you can move until you threaten the next closest enemy.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Full Attack</mark>

You can make (remaining speed/30) additional superior attacks a turn.\
Basically, make an attack as a free action for every 30 feet you haven't used this turn.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You cannot use techniques after <mark style="color:red;">full attacking</mark>. If you dash, use an action that resembles dash, or if you use a technique during your turn, you cannot <mark style="color:red;">full attack.</mark>
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Rush of Battle!</mark>

During combat your speed increases by (30\*lvl-30), but you must always end your movement threatening an enemy.&#x20;

If you ever end your turn not threatening any enemy for any reason, you receive a stacking 30 speed penalty each turn, to a minimum of your speed before this buff is taken into an account.\
You also become clumsy 1.
