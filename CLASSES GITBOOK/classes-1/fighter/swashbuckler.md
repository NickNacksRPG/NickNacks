Parry functions in 2 different ways.

<mark style="color:green;">Prepare to Parry</mark> - You can choose to forgo any number of attacks during your turn. Until the start of your next turn you can parry as an instant action a number of times equal to the number of attacks you decided to forego. If you successfully negate an attack, you can riposte and make a melee attack against the creature as an instant action.

<mark style="color:green;">Reactive Parry</mark> - You can attempt to parry an attack without preparing by spending 2 panache.  If you successfully negate an attack, you can riposte make a melee attack against the creature as an immediate action.
