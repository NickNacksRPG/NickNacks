# üëÅÔ∏è Dark Knight

Stand stalwart in the face of danger, an immovable obstacle that your opponents must fight tooth and nail to merely walk past, let alone survive. Outside of combat your massive skill bonuses can allow you to sense what others don't, and sniff out liars.

Based on the Maplestory class of the same name.
