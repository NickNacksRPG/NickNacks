Wind Swordsman are focused on being annoying and slippery with an incredibly powerful signature attack: Steel Tempest. Their abilities are centered around mobility to get into a better position to use this attack.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Special Attack: Steel Tempest (Su)</mark>

Once per round when you land a melee attack against a creature, gain a stack of gathering storm. With two stacks of gathering storm, you can use this special attack. This special attack can be used any number of times in a combat.

Your attack whips up a whirlwind, targeting all enemies in a 60 ft line. Compare your attack roll to the ac of all creatures in the line. Those you hit are staggered for one round and take an additional d6/odd lvl damage. \
Attacks landed with this special attack do not generate gathering storm stacks.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Flow \[healing]</mark>

Keep a running tally of how far you move. Every time you move 60 ft, you gain (4+2\*lvl) temp hp. This temp hp lasts indefinitely.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Sweeping Blade \[elusive]</mark>

Once per creature per round, you can choose to dash in a straight line through a creature within reach as a free action, appearing directly on the opposite side of the creature. You can also choose to continue dashing in the same direction until you leave the creature's threatened zone. This movement doesn't count against your movement each round.

You can combine sweeping blade with steel tempest, creating a new unique effect. You can either attack a 60 ft line as usual, or you can choose to attack a 10 ft radius around your destination.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Wind Wall (Sp) \[recharge]</mark>

You can innately cast [Wind Wall](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/clairvoyance/level-2/wind-wall). You can use wind wall as an immediate action, but its size is decreased to a 15x15 square, its duration changes to 1 round and its range decreases to reach. It does not impede you or your allies' movement or attacks.

The penalty to ranged attacks also applies to the DC of any ability that must physically pass through the wall. It would not apply to a spell like [charming gaze](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/shira/level-1/charming-gaze), but it would apply to a spell like [bestial claw](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/beastmode/level-1/bestial-claw).

You can only use this ability again after 1 minute passes.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Ride the Wind</mark>

You can use sweeping blade against a single target you attack with steel tempest.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Already Dead (Su) \[teleportation]</mark>

As an immediate action, you can teleport adjacent to any creature you can see within 30 feet that gets inflicted with a debilitating status effect (such stagger, poisoned, sickened) and make a simple attack against them. This ability must be used in response to the status being inflicted, it cannot be used against a creature that merely happened to be status'd.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Last Breath</mark>

Creatures hit by steel tempest are dazed for one round.
