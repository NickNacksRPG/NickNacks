# Standard Fighter

Rally your allies around a point and fight together. Standard fighters are still self-sufficient, but become more powerful with allies.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Martial Standard (Su) \[force]</mark>

As a swift action, summon a flag from the sky and have it slam down onto an unoccupied space within 30 ft of you. Enemies within 5 ft of it take (1+lvl) force damage. You can choose to automatically pick up your flag by moving into its space, recharging this ability. A creature can knock over your flag by rolling athletics as a swift action (DC 10+your athletics bonus), causing it to disappear and recharging this ability. The flag automatically disappears after 1 minute.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Flag Aura</mark>

While within 30 ft of your flag, your allies share your team work feats. Your flag counts as an ally to you for the purposes of fulfilling teamwork feat conditions.

Gain a teamwork feat at lvl 1, 4, 8, 12.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Secret Language: Semaphore</mark>

You speak the language of flag twirling. When communicating, you do it letter by letter, limiting its use to simple messages unless you spend a very long time.

Your flag bears the mark of a country, guild or religion of significance. Members of the countries army or officials of the country, important members of your religion or guild etc. intuitively understand your messages.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Bullying Blow</mark>

At the start of your turn, you can decide to forfeit the ability to make combat maneuvers until the start of your next turn. When you do so, attacks deal poise damage equal to the hp damage they deal until the start of your next turn.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Slap Sense \[healing]</mark>

Once per round in place of an attack, you can slap some sense into a creature suffering from a \[mind affecting] effect. They take 1 true damage and get an additional save against an effect of your choosing. If the effect had no DC, use the creature/entities offense trait DC/class DC.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Capture the Flag \[elusive]</mark>

Make a charge attack targeting your flag from any distance, as long as you can see it and there is a direct path. Any creature in your path is automatically pushed out of your way on either side of you (your choice). Melee attack any creature within reach during this charge.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Bolster</mark>

You can use the aid action as a swift action. If your flag is within your natural reach when you use this feature, you use the aid action to give the same bonus to all creatures in your flag's aura.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Swag Flag</mark>

If when you summon your flag a creature is defeated by it, you can summon it again at a new location as a free action.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Golden Aegis</mark>

When you summon your flag, and at the start of each of your turns, allies within its aura gain 5 temp hp.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Supreme Standard</mark>

When you summon your flag, you can choose to activate this ability or not for its duration.

The outer radius of your flags aura has a visible barrier around it. Creatures can pass through it freely, but attacks, spells, offense traits, thrown objects, weather effects and plenty of other things cannot. Any AoE effects are halted along the barriers edge. Even persistent ones like darkness or wall of fire are cut off. Whichever side of the barrier had more of the effect is where it persists.

In general, creatures on opposite sides of the barrier have line of sight, but do not have line of effect.
