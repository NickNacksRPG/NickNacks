# ðŸ©¸ Bloody Finger

Suddenly end fights with the power cause creatures to explode into bloody chunks long after you cut them with your blade.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Bleed Them Out</mark>

Any piercing or slashing weapon you wield gains the bleed property. Whenever you hit a creature with a bleed weapon (even if it does no damage), keep a running tally of how many times the creature was hit. This number is referred to as "bleed stacks" and is separate from other bleed effects. Crits apply 2 bleed stacks. Bleed stacks are visible on the creatures body and last until you rest.

Even if a creature cannot bleed, it can still gain bleed stacks.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Hemorrhage (Su)</mark>

Sheathe your weapon(s) as a standard action. Creatures that have bleed stacks (no matter the distance) lose all stacks and take 2d6 (7) true damage. Creatures with 5+ stacks take 8d6 (28) true damage. Creatures with 10+ stacks take 16d6 (56) damage. This damage continues to double every 5 stacks infinitely.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Bloodied Finger</mark>

One of the bloody finger's fingers is always a crimson red. It can be used to write in a bloody ink.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Weeb Training</mark>

You can dual wield one handed weapons using dex or strength as long as the weapon has a Japanese name.\
If you wield a Japanese weapon in two hands, it applies 2 bleed stacks on hit, or 4 on a crit.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Special Attack: Bloody Slash (Su)</mark>

Make a thrown weapon attack with a held weapon without actually throwing it, instead throwing a sharp projectile shaped like your weapon. If dual wielding, throw one with each weapon.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Invasion \[Sigil]</mark>

You can inscribe your name, or a symbol of significance to you on a surface using your bloodied finger. When a creature triggers the sigil, you get a glimpse of the surrounding area briefly. Anytime it is triggered, you can choose to crawl out of the sigil as though you were summoning yourself, causing the sigil to disappear. You can stay summoned this way for 5 minutes before you return to your body.

You cannot use this feature while you have summoning sickness. If you create a sigil while you already have one, the old one disappears.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Rivers of Blood \[recharge]</mark>

As a standard action, slash the air rapidly, causing many bloody projectiles to fly out in a 30 ft cone in front of you. Creatures in the area take 6d6 (21) slash or pierce damage and get 4 bleed stacks (reflex halves damage and bleed stacks).

This ability recharges when you use your hemorrhage ability against a creature with 5 or more bleed stacks.

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Blood Scent</mark>

Gain blind sense (scent 100 ft) against wounded creatures. Gain seeking against wounded creatures.

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Lord of Blood</mark>

Whenever a creature takes bleed damage within 30 ft of you, they gain a bleed stack.
