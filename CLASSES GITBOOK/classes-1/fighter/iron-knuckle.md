# Iron Knuckle

Your armor is a second skin to you. Your armor is also your first skin. The iron knuckle has 2 "phases" to their battles. The first is a walking tank with multiple layers of armor, durable and stubborn until you get to the squishy _single layer_ of plate armor underneath. The second is a nimble warrior that gets a boost of adrenaline, feeling light as a feather just after their outer shell is cracked open.

Iron knuckles are practically invincible to being attacked head on while layered up, and must be ganged up on or their armor destroyed. Mages will find a much easier time breaking the outer layer

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Metallurgy</mark>

You are fused with a set of standard metal plate armor. You can enhance this armor with new metals and enchantments with a more involved process. You are permanently treated as though you are wearing heavy armor. It is part of you and cannot be separated without causing extreme life-threatening damage to you.

Because this armor is a part of you, it being destroyed hurts you. Whenever your armor is sundered it  deals 10 true damage to you instead of its usual effects. Other effects that destroy/degrade armor can also do this.

You add construct to your creature types. You gain proficiency in the profession (blacksmith) skill.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Layer Up</mark>

You can choose to put on an additional layer of heavy armor over the first, providing you with the following benefits after 1 minute of preparation.

* +4 AC
* You benefit from the [Quake](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/cataclysm/level-1/quake) technique constantly

While <mark style="color:red;">layered up</mark> you also take a -5 penalty to your speed and cannot fly or hover.

Enemies can remove layer up by dealing damage that drops you below half hp.

It takes 3 rounds to remove layer up manually.

It requires a set of heavy armor in order to use layer up. When an enemy removes layer up, you cannot use that particular set of heavy armor to layer up again until you repair it. Be sure to pick it up after the battle!

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Light as a Feather</mark>

After carrying the weight of incredibly heavy metal armor during the heat of battle, to have the burden removed suddenly fills the iron knuckle with new vigor. When an enemy removes <mark style="color:red;">layer up</mark> from you, you become <mark style="color:red;">light as a feather</mark>, gaining the following benefits.

* You gain (10+2\*lvl) temp hp \[healing], potentially preventing you from dying from single instances of damage. You are set to 1 hp in such cases.
* Your speed and jump distance increases by 10 until combat ends.
* You can choose to be immediately effected by the [Unbreakable Advance](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/pupper/level-3/unbreakable-advance) technique.
* You gain access to the <mark style="color:red;">sudden strike</mark> special attack until combat ends.

<mark style="color:red;">Special Attack: Sudden Strike</mark> - Advance 10 ft towards an enemy \[elusive] and make a melee attack. On hit the target is pushed back 5 feet and knocked down. On a graze the target is only pushed back 5 ft. Deals an additional d6/odd lvl damage.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Metallicize</mark>

Your armor shifts to steady your stance, and absorbs bits of metal from things you break. You recover 5 poise at the start of your turn. When you sunder metal equipment, or use athetics to break metal objects, recover 10 poise.

This poise recovery cannot exceed your poise maximum.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Bully</mark>

You gain the [power pose](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/combat-feats/power-pose) feat. When you use it, it deals 15 poise damage instead of 10.

If you are <mark style="color:red;">layered up</mark> then you can use it as an instant action 1/turn. You can use power pose against AoOs an unlimited number of times as an instant action.

You can choose if you want to leave a creature at 1 poise, or poise break them with this ability. If a creature is poise broken by this ability then they are made clumsy 2, or you can sunder the equipment used to attack.

While <mark style="color:red;">light as a feather</mark>, when a creature misses you with an AoO, or you successfully use acrobatics to evade AoOs, you can make a bully attack as an instant action.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Bull Rush</mark>

If you are <mark style="color:red;">layered up</mark>, when you shove a creature, you can move with them to increase the shove distance by your remaining movement.

While <mark style="color:red;">light as a feather</mark>, you gain [powerful charge](https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/monster-qualities/offense-traits#powerful-charge).

## <mark style="color:green;">6 - Adrenaline</mark>

If you are <mark style="color:red;">layered up</mark> then you are immune to fatigue.

You gain the innate technique [adrenaline burst](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/scoundrel/level-3/adrenaline-burst) while <mark style="color:red;">light as a feather</mark>.

## <mark style="color:green;">8 - Invincible</mark>

You are immune to attack rolls made by minions while <mark style="color:red;">layered up</mark>. Any minion that attacks you is instead set to 1 poise automatically as it bounces off of your metal body.

While <mark style="color:red;">light as a feather</mark>, you gain resistance to damage from failed saving throws. If the ability has no effect other than damage, and does half damage on a passed save, you need not make a saving throw.

## <mark style="color:green;">10 - Exoskeleton</mark>

???

## <mark style="color:green;">11 - Special Attack: Iron Wave \[healing]</mark>

Strike at a foe, dealing an additional 6d6 (21) damage. If you are <mark style="color:red;">layered up</mark>, gain temp hp and poise equal to the total damage dealt. If <mark style="color:red;">light as a feather</mark>, also immediately layer up again until this temp hp is lost.

This poise recovery cannot exceed your poise maximum.
