# ⛈️ Thunderlord

A thunderlord's specialty is disruption. Knocking people around with rushing wind and cacophonous attacks.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Blown Away</mark>

Whenever you deal sonic damage or crush damage from an \[air] effect, you push the creature you damage 10 ft directly away from you. If the effect already pushed the creature, it pushes them an additional 10 ft.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - AS: Reverberating Strike \[sonic]</mark>

Deal an additional 2d6+CL (7+CL) thunder damage on hit and energize your foe for 1 round. They take an additional 2d6 (7) sonic damage if they move of their own volition, no matter the method.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - AS: Wind Strike \[air]</mark>

Strike an enemy, dealing no additional damage, but instead surrounding in a tempest that cuts into them as they move for one round. They take d8 (4) slashing damage for every 5 feet they move, no matter the method.

## <mark style="color:green;">? - Reverberations (Sp) \[air]</mark>

At the start of your turn as a swift action, you can spend 1 mana to unleash powerful winds upon creatures within 10 ft of you, dealing 2d6 (7) crush damage (fort negates).

## <mark style="color:green;">? - Thunderous Smite (Sp) \[sonic]</mark>

If you spend 1 mana as an immediate action when you take damage, you can blast your attacker with a sonic blast if they are within 30 ft. They take 2d6+CL (7+CL) sonic damage (fort halves).
