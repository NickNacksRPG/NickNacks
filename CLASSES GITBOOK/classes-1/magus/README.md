# Magus

What if sword wizard? The magus specializes in dishing out sword swings and spells in equal measure, learning to combine them in unique ways. The magus has the ability to conjure magic blades out of thin air to augment his fighting style, or supercharge his weapon with magic to unleash devastating single hits. The magus is one of the most versatile in their ability to destroy their enemies.
