# Actor

An actor is not merely a performer. These jesters use their voice and appearance to cause confusion in all but the most perceptive bunch. Throw your voice and rapidly change who you are on a dime to make people think they are interacting with many people. Actors can pull all kinds of ridiculous stunts to get them into and out of trouble.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Everyone, Everywhere, All at Once (Su)</mark>

Your proficiency in disguise is unmatched. You make a disguise as a swift action. Not only that, but you can be two people at once! This typically only functions with a singular person. You can change appearances and positions such that as long as both of your disguised personas are not visible at once, you can effectively inhabit both of them. In such scenarios you typically cause people to keep turning around to face whoever is speaking.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Throw Voice</mark>

You are constantly under the effects of [ventriloquism](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-1/ventriloquism). It does not have the buff tag. You can have your voice originate from a place you cannot see, such as around a corner or as a muffled voice inside of a chest.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Professional</mark>

With proper venues, you can use disguise to make money as thought using a profession.

## _<mark style="color:green;">Talents</mark>_

Gain one each even level. Numbers next to the name are level requirements.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - I Yield, I Yield!</mark>

You can roll deception as an immediate action when you fall below (10+2\*lvl) hp to pretend as though you have lost the will to fight. The inflicting creature or their leader within 30 ft roll opposed insight. If you succeed, they ignore you until rejoin the fight. When you do, the first creature you attack is DD.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Flesh Wound/Deadly Wound</mark>

You can exaggerate how painful something was, or make it seem as though something did not hurt at all. Roll deception or disguise (opposed by perception, insight or medicine) and you can play off a deadly wound as though it was nothing, even if it defeated you. In such a case you are still unable to perform actions,  but your speed while defeated is not reduced.

You can also do this when you take a relatively insignificant amount of damage to try and garner sympathy, or to convince a third party the attacker was trying to kill you etc.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Statuesque</mark>

You can use disguise to appear as a statue. While a statue, you cannot move or perform any actions, and otherwise functions as [hide in plain sight](https://app.gitbook.com/s/LcHjOjPnBbxeu9BQoJ8P/monster-qualities/other-traitss).

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Traditional Theater</mark>

You can stir up a commotion to gather attention, only to hit your audience with some of the most mind-numbingly boring or awful performances they have every seen. When you begin your performance, decide whether you want to make it boring or cringe to decide its effects. Boring performances put audiences to sleep and cringe ones make them run to the hills (will negates).

The creature with the highest will save is the one to roll a collective save for the audience. They are the brave audience member willing to break the audience's silence and boo you off the stage, snapping the rest of the audience out of it.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Sorry, Not Sorry</mark>

You can harm or inconvenience someone without consequence. By first feigning assistance with a particular task, you can use it as an excuse to destroy items, spill beverages and overall show off how incompetent you can be. Creatures roll insight/perception (or perhaps even profession!) opposed to your disguise or deception. If you succeed, they are upset, but there are no immediate repercussions and you are just a waiter who fades into the background. Failure indicates a more intimate grilling and consequences appropriate for your misdeeds.

You can attempt to do this repeatedly to the same person, but you have disadvantage on your skill checks.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Auction House</mark>

You can make the description of an item so tantalizing, so incredible that they must have it. During conversation, you can gloss up a particular item. You don't even need to possess the item, but it does need to exist. You can roll deception to exaggerate its quality, value or even function. If the creature fails its insight check, it immediately runs off to go find this item, or tries to get it from you.

With this feature, you can essentially use deception as a profession skill to generate money. However you will damage your reputation by doing so.
