# Mime

You have to feel it to believe it. Mimes are exceptionally good at making the precise hand and body movements to convince others that what their gestures imply exist really do. So much so that they won't believe it when they actually do!

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Pantomime (Su) \[concentration] \[mana burn]</mark>

You can create objects out of thin air. Said objects must relatively simple and fit within a 10x10x10 ft cube. You can mime a flat wall, but you can't make a rat maze. You can mime a long rope, but you cannot mime a pulley system. Miming requires a standard action.

Outside of these limitations, you can do anything. Let your imagination run wild as you mime staircases, simple tools and all kinds of other things into existence at your convenience, and your enemies' inconvenience.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Practiced Routines (Su)</mark>

A mime has a few routines that require significantly less strain in order to manifest. These specific uses of pantomime do not have the \[mana burn] tag, but are more limited in scope. Each use costs 1 mana. You gain the "build a wall" practiced routine and another of your choosing at level 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.

<mark style="color:green;">Build A Wall</mark> - You cause a flat 10x10 invisible wall to appear perpendicular to the direction you gesture. A creature cannot pass through it without a successful will save. Once a creature succeeds, all others make the save with advantage. If the initial creature fails, all others have disadvantage until one passes.

<mark style="color:green;">Omnitool</mark> - You can pantomime a [mundane tool](https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/mundane-items/tools), such as a fishing rod, a pick axe or a hammer. It only functions while in your hands, but otherwise functions as expected.\
<mark style="color:green;">Lasso</mark> - You can pantomime rope, tying it around objects and using it as a lasso to hook around distant objects. There is no limit to how long you can make it, but it must be one continuous string. Other creatures can use the rope if they see you pantomiming it.\
<mark style="color:green;">Binoculars</mark> - You put your hands over your eyes to enhance your vision. You can see distances hundreds of feet away with much greater detail.\
<mark style="color:green;">Finger Gun</mark> - You can point at someone with your thumb in the air and move your thumb down to touch your index finger to "fire" at them. The creature takes 2d8+CL (9+CL) psychic damage (will halves). You can "upcast" this ability as though it were a spell, adding an additional d8 (4) of damage per additional mana spent.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Speechless</mark>

You can cast spells without verbal components.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Charades \[mind-affecting]</mark>&#x20;

You can use your pantomiming skills to cause creatures to say things they might not normally say out loud. In neutral and friendly scenarios, you can start a game of charades. Choose one creature in particular to be your victim, then create an elaborate pantomime that causes them to say something in specific (will negates). This could be something silly like "Colonel Mustard in the library with a candle stick" or something more nefarious like "those disgusting green immigrants." Pass or fail, when you initiate this goading charade, the game ends as a result of awkwardness or everybody else getting discouraged at your weird pantomime. The response is generally limited to a short sentence.

Creatures subject to this ability cannot be subject to it again until you rest.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Silent Theater</mark>

You gain [silence](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-2/silence) and [silencing strike](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/arc/level-1/silencing-strike) as innate techniques.\
By spending 2 mana, you can cast silence as a swift action on yourself.
