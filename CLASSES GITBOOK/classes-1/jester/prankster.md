# Prankster

Pranksters are the most ridiculous type of jesters. They are capable of doing things people typically might expect from cartoons. Taking your eyes off of them for just a second is a sure fire way to let them get away. They use incredible feats of acrobatics and sleight of hand in order to troll their enemies&#x20;

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Pranked!</mark>

As a swift action, you can perform a prank. What this entails varies based on what kind of prank you choose.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Slipping and Sliding</mark> - Pull out your banana peels and oil slicks. Toss one into a creatures space or into an empty space. It persists until cleaned up. The creature you tossed the prank at, and any creatures that later move into this space are knocked down (reflex negates).\
<mark style="color:green;">Realistic Replicas</mark> - As long as nobody has direct line of sight of you, you can manufacture a dangerous and silly prank. You cover up a door, you hide a switch or you paint a cave into a wall with exceptional speed. A creature must roll perception against your sleight of hand or they don't realize the deception. They are immediately subject to a dirty trick, as though you had poise broken them, and they take 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) damage of an appropriate type.\
<mark style="color:green;">Lemon Chaser</mark> - Throw some fuel on the fire to bring the pain. In this case, the fuel is citrus juice and the fire is an opponent within reach. If the creature is not damaged, this does nothing. If the creature is missing, hp, the creature becomes sickened 1 from the intense pain (fort negates). If they are bleeding, they instead become sickened 2 (fort halves).\
<mark style="color:green;">Flower Power \[recharge]</mark> - You activate a pocket ornament, allowing you to spray an unsuspecting foe. You make a creature within reach wet. Usable 1/combat.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Uncontainable</mark>

While you are trapped inside of a room, or a cage, cell etc, you automatically escape the moment someone doesn't keep an eye on your for at least one full round (or 6 seconds). You can never tell people how because a magician never reveals his secrets.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Kinesthetic Learner</mark>

Instead of disguise and deception, you gain proficiency and a +4 bonus with acrobatics and sleight of hand.

## _<mark style="color:green;">Talents</mark>_

Gain one each even level. Numbers next to the name are level requirements.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Juggling</mark>

As long as your hands are open and you do not wear a shield, you can effectively wield 3 different items at a time, provided each one could normally be used with one hand. You can add an additional item to the mix every even level.&#x20;

You can also choose include random objects on your person, or that you pick up. Creatures cannot take these items from you unless they successfully disarm you.

If you are ever stunned or dazed, you stop juggling, and you can choose what items you still hold in hand.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Balancing Act</mark>

As a swift action, you can roll acrobatics to jump directly onto a creature, balancing on their shoulders, back etc (reflex negates).

When you jump on and at the start of your turn while you are balancing on a creature, they are made clumsy 1. You can be removed by poise breaking, or anything that forcefully moves you from your position. Any AoE effect that targets you also targets the creature you balance on.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Make them Disappear!</mark>

Given 3 rounds of setup, you can plan an elaborate ruse. Using mirrors, conveniently camouflaged hidey holes and hidden compartments in boxes, you can appear to make creatures completely disappear. The creature with the highest perception bonus in a group of onlookers rolls perception opposed by your sleight of hand. If you succeed, then the creature you choose can slip away undetected for the next minute. After the minute is up, people catch on, realize it isn't a joke etc and start the search...If they care.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Vanishing Act (Su)</mark>

Whenever you take damage, you have a 33% chance to disappear from sight in a cloud of smoke, deflating or something equally unusual, rendering you [invisible](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/moogen/level-6/invisibility) until the start of your next turn.

I recommend making effects like this a high roll. AKA a 5 or 6 on a d6.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - All Hot Air (Su)</mark>

Take a deep breath, stick your thumb in your mouth and blow on it as a swift action. Doing so causes your body to expand in delightfully silly ways.\
<mark style="color:green;">Belly -</mark> Inflate yourself. Just like a balloon. This gives you a 10 ft fly speed as long as you hold your breath and perform no actions other than movement.\
<mark style="color:green;">Brain -</mark> Big brain time. You gain a +2 bonus to the next intelligence based check you make this round.\
<mark style="color:green;">Hand -</mark> Increase the size of your hand. Your next unarmed strike this turn adds (d6/odd level) damage.\
<mark style="color:green;">Assets -</mark> Attempt to charm a creature (will negates). They have a +4 bonus on the save if they wouldn't normally be attracted to you due to sexual orientation (or lack thereof for something like a robot). In combat the charmed creature gets a new save every turn. Out of combat the charm lasts 10 minutes, and once it wears off, the creature cannot be charmed again until rest.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Squashed (Su)</mark>

You gain a special attack.

<mark style="color:green;">Flatten</mark> - Smush a creature against the ground with such force that they are practically rendered two-dimensional. The creature has their speed reduced by 15 and their reach reduced to 5 ft. This lasts until an ally uses the aid action on them, or the creature spends a standard action.\
The damage of this attack is changed to bludgeoning. It deals your level in additional damage.

You can use this special attack on your allies or yourself in order to slip underneath things like doors. You can much more easily hide underneath furniture etc. Allies take no damage from this attack and can exit their smushed state as a swift action.
