# ðŸ¤¡ Jester

Jesters are masters of misdirection. Their methodology varies, but the goal is always the same: Confound and deceive. Some choose to do so with prestidigitation, drawing the eyes of creatures where they want, and more importantly, away from where they don't. Others use their voices and costumes to have a 3 way conversation with only themselves and their poor victim. One should always keep their eyes on a jester and their goals, for the moment they don't, they might just disappear.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Technique Specialization (Mixed)</mark>

You gain 2 technique points at level 1, then another point every 2 levels after.\
These technique points can be used on the scoundrel and moogen trees.

Characters with magical specialization gain points in wild card equal to their highest tier of magic technique and 6 cantrips.\
Characters with martial specialization gain points in warfare equal to their highest tier of martial technique.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Master of Deception</mark>

You get proficiency in the disguise and deception skills, with a +4 bonus. You also gain the Signature Skill feat for disguise. You start play with a [disguise kit](https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/mundane-items/tools).

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Fight Dirty</mark>

As a swift action, you can make a special type of attack against an enemy.

<mark style="color:red;">Mockery \[psychic]</mark> - Deal (d4+lvl) psychic damage to a creature within 30 ft and give them disadvantage on their next attack roll (will halves dmg and negates disadvantage). If you can personalize the insult to an extent the GM determines it digs deep, the DC is 2 higher.\
<mark style="color:red;">Disarm</mark> - Roll a disarm attack. In additional to its usual effects, roll base weapon damage, unless a technique already does so.\
<mark style="color:red;">Trick</mark> - Roll a dirty trick attack. In additional to its usual effects, roll base weapon damage, unless a technique already does so.

## <mark style="color:green;">1 - Cutting Words \[recharge]</mark>

Roast your enemies, causing them to falter when it matters most. As an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 ft to subtract a d6 to a d20 roll (minus luck checks). At level 6 this increases to d8. At level 10 this improves to d10.

This ability can be used once per minute. You can ignore the recharge time and use it again if you \[mana burn] 2.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Jack of All Trades</mark>

Add 1+Â½ lvl to all skills that you lack proficiency in. You can make checks for all skills as though you were proficient.\
You also have the unique ability to perform any skill in unconventional (and sometimes nonsensical) ways. This could mean using strange tools, using your feet instead of your hands and adding superfluous steps for added flare.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Hidden Props (Su)</mark>

After a minute of scheming with an item in direct contact with you, you can make sure that this item is always there when you need it. This item must be something you can carry and must fit within a 5x5x5ft cube. You can only have one hidden prop at the ready at a time. You procure these items by pulling them out of hidden hatches, around corners or from behind someones ear. If it is a handheld object (like a trumpet or a sword), this requires no action. Anything larger requires a swift action.

These items effectively do not exist as long as you have them as hidden props. They cannot be stolen from you and they do not exist in a specific place. They exist wherever it is most convenient for the jester at any given moment, making other creatures unable to interact with them if you believe it inconvenient.

If you are killed, the items fall out of your pocket. Nonlethal methods of retrieving these items against the jester's will require charms, curses and the like.

## <mark style="color:green;">2 - Audience Plant \[recharge]</mark>

There is a secret network of jesters, their assistants and their fans that all work to aid each other. As long as you are in a situation where there are others present but not currently in sight (such as a person in a nearby shop, or guards in the adjacent room), you can give a signal to have them act. Depending on the type of signal, you can have them act differently.

<mark style="color:green;">Cause a Commotion</mark> - The plant will cause a ruckus by shouting, playing music and being obnoxious. At the very least, it will momentarily draw the attention of creatures so you can hide (or something similar).\
<mark style="color:green;">Vouch For Me</mark> - A random member of the crowd cheers for you, or a prison guard tells their coworker to lay off you a bit. This isn't enough to get you out of situations, but will likely give people pause before inflicting any form of harsh judgement.\
<mark style="color:green;">Oops?</mark> - The plant will "accidentally" do something, like opening a window in the way of someone chasing you, or unlocking a door for you to let you inside.

In order to recharge this ability, you have to return the favor in some way to the person that assisted you after the situation resolves itself. Usually if you remain in the area, they will come to find you.

## <mark style="color:green;">4 - Status Quo (Su)</mark>

Spend 1 minute familiarizing yourself with an area. You can interact with an environment, including moving things, painting things, destroying things etc. Then as a standard action _while nobody is looking_, you can cause it to revert back to its original state, sans minor details like you stealing items from a safe, or adding a few innocuous items. You can do this even if you are not present. You can intuitively tell when nobody is looking and you can use this ability.
