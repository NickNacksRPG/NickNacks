# ðŸŒ‹ Lava

Molten rock and metal. Lava is most commonly found around volcanoes, but can also be found erupting from the ocean floor and flowing through deep underground caverns.

Lava typically comes in 2 variations; semisolid and liquid. Both are considered \[persistent] effects.

<mark style="color:red;">Semisolid Lava</mark> - Semisolid lava feels a bit like chunky mud if it melted your toes. Semisolid lava is difficult terrain, and every turn you move through it, you take 4d6 (14) fire damage.

<mark style="color:red;">Liquid Lava</mark> - Liquid lava is much more dangerous since it can pool into large enough quantities for you to get completely submerged in. Each round you are submerged in lava, you take 10d6 (35) fire damage and are drained 1.

If you survive that and manage to escape, lava still clings to you, burning you while it cools. This damage starts at 4d6 (14), then decreases by d6 each round until it ends. By taking cold damage, getting hit with a \[water] effect or otherwise rapidly cooling or removing the clinging lava, you can avoid this damage over time.&#x20;

If you are only partially submerged, like if it is only waist deep, the initial damage is reduced to 6d6 (21) fire, and the cling damage starts at 3d6 (10) fire.&#x20;
