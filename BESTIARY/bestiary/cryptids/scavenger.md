<mark style="color:green;">**Resistance**</mark> - Poison

<mark style="color:green;">**Rigor Mortis \[recharge] \[healing]**</mark> - When a scavenger is killed, they do not truly die. They are exceptionally good at playing dead locking their limbs and slowing their bodily functions to almost inactive. A creature trained in medicine can identify when such a creature is not truly dead passively if their bonus is at least +6, or automatically if they attend to the "corpse" for whatever reason (looting, moving it etc).

If the scavenger is not killed within the next minute, it rises back up and heals 10 hp. It must use its _spoiled appetite_ ability to recharge this ability.

<mark style="color:green;">**Spoiled Appetite \[healing]**</mark> - A scavenger relishes the opportunity to consume rotting viscera and bone. A creature must have been dead for at least 24 hours to be worthwhile to consume to a scavenger, though the longer the better.&#x20;

As a swift action against an adjacent corpse, a scavenger can consume such meat to heal 10 hp. If the creature is undead, they instead heal 15 hp. A small/medium creature can be the target of this ability once. Each size above medium allows an additional targeting.

<mark style="color:red;">**Frenzy \[recharge]**</mark> - Consuming a delicious meal energizes a scavenger like nothing else. As a swift action, a scavenger can enter frenzy for 1 round, giving them resistance to all damage and an additional 30 speed. Recharges when they use their _spoiled appetite_ ability.

They also get access to the following special attack.

<mark style="color:red;">**Special Attack: Eviscerate**</mark> - Only usable in frenzy.\

<mark style="color:red;">**Flavored Enemy**</mark> - Scavengers get a +4 bonus to attack against undead creatures.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Disgusting Addiction**</mark> - Scavengers love the taste of undead creatures over all else. Once combat starts, they are persistently taunted by any present undead.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Friends, not Food**</mark> - The scavenger was originally created by a [boner](https://app.gitbook.com/s/RMbLojcVzvAZ0Dwd2Vjs/races/boner) alchemist and it is baked into the scavenger that boners are friends, not food. They cannot willingly harm boners.
