<mark style="color:red;">**Menacing Gaze \[fear]**</mark> - By spending 30 feet of movement, the chieftain can demoralize a creature with the power of their blood lust alone. This functions as the demoralize action under the intimidation skill.

<mark style="color:red;">**Special Attack: Frenzied Strike**</mark> - The chieftain grows noticeably more jittery as their muscles bulge, their mouth froths and their eyes roll into the back of their head. A chieftain makes an amount of simple axe attacks equal to (1+the number of turns they have made a frenzied strike this combat), stacking up to 4 attacks at once.&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">Dishonorable COWARDS</mark> - Can only be used in response to a creature breaking the rules of Mak'Gora. Immediately use the [Warcry ](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/martial-techniques/warfare/level-3/warcry)technique, and its radius increases to 40 ft.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Mak'Gora**</mark> - Chieftain of an orc tribe is an ever shifting position, and a chief must be ready to defend their position. If you challenge the chieftain to a duel, they may be willing to partake depending on the circumstances. Even if they don't the pressure of their peers may goad them into it (will negates, DC). If they pass their save they make up an excuse to placate their band of warriors.

The murderous chieftain and the members of their tribe fight with honor to the death, and will not aid each other using magic, items etc, before or during the fight. It is expected the opponent does the same. Breaking the rules in the middle of the battle, such as to cast a spell on an ally, causes the duel to break down and a chaotic battle ensues. In such cases, the war chief gets access to the a new boss action.&#x20;

A war band will respect the results of the battle, and bow to whoever is the victor.
