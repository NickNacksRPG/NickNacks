<mark style="color:green;">**Flyby Attack**</mark> - An ayylmao's movement is \[elusive] against targets it has attacked this round.

<mark style="color:red;">**Discomfort**</mark> - Ayylmao like sticking their probes in unusual places. Creatures are sent reeling and are made clumsy 1 on hit. Against a DD or grappled target, this increases to clumsy 2.

<mark style="color:red;">**Tractor Beam (Su) \[concentration]**</mark> - Unleash a ray at a creature within 30 ft. It is entangled (reflex negates). A DC 20 athletics check as a standard action frees the creature. While entangled, the creature maintains the exact distance away from the ayylmao, even if it moves. This allows the ayylmao to slam it into the ground, drag it along walls etc. Every turn it moves at least 10 feet deals 4d6 (14) crush damage. If the ayylmao chooses, it can spend its own movement to beam the creature closer, or push it away, but no farther than 30 feet away.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Milkers**</mark> - There's only one thing an ayylmao likes more than anal probing, and that's cows. If any cows or cow-like creatures are present, an ayylmao will always focus on kidnapping them with their tractor beams over anything else.

A substantial quantity of cow milk gives creatures advantage on checks in social situations with ayylmao.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:yellow;background-color:yellow;">Other Traits</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Ability Scores - Str +0, Dex +2, Lucc +0, Int +3, Wis +0, Cha +0**</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Telepathy**</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Cloaking Device**</mark> - Ayylmao can take 10 on stealth (resulting in 22 for the average ayylmao). They are always considered to have partial concealment while the cloaking device is active. The cloaking device is deactivated when an ayylmao does anything other than movement, or it takes damage. The only exception is if the action has the \[subtle] tag.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Speed**</mark> - 40 hover, 10 land. An ayylmao can use its hover speed to fly, but only during its turn.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Takeoff**</mark> - An ayylmao can return to the mother ship by spending 3 consecutive standard actions activating turbo thrusters. It also leaves with any creature caught in its tractor beam.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Feats**</mark> - [Skill Focus (Stealth)](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vxnMGGHnEtmcEQDFxcK6/general-feats/skill-focus), [Signature Skill (Stealth)](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/stealth)

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Skills**</mark> - +5 perception, 22 stealth, +8 arcana, +12 engineering, +8 cryptozoology, +8 nature
