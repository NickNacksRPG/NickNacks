<mark style="color:red;">**Charming Gaze \[charm]**</mark> - A besmolder has many eyes, but one particularly large one it uses to cancel make new friends. At the start of the besmolder's turn, it decides to focus it's gaze on a single creature it can see (free action). The creature is charmed for 1 round (will negates). It cannot use its eye stalks ability against targets it charms.

<mark style="color:red;">**Eyestalks**</mark> - The besmolder's extra eyes have the ability to unleash devastating laser beams at creatures within 100 ft. As a standard action it can shoot three of these laser beams at three different creatures. The effect is rolled randomly (reroll duplicates), more details below.\
\
Outside of combat, the besmolder is able to exert more fine control over its eye stalks, allowing it to summon friends, build little villages, telekinetically move objects and disintegrate holes into things with ease. Feel free to change up a few eye beams to make your besmolder's extra special.

<mark style="color:orange;">9 - Story Time! \[companion]</mark> - Summon a level 4 or lower creature adjacent to target. It acts immediately. (note, you may want to select the besmolder's friends beforehand to make things like tokens more seamless).

{% hint style="info" %}
A besmolder can only have 2 creatures created at a time out of combat using "Story Time" but during combat, they can have up to 4. If they already have 4 and roll storytime again, reroll that result.\
When defeated, the creatures fade away.
{% endhint %}

<mark style="color:orange;">10 - Oopsie! \[force]</mark> - Target takes 10d10 (55) force damage (reflex halves). If this defeats the creature, they are turned into a fine dust.\

<mark style="color:orange;">12 - The Floor is Lava \[persistent]</mark> - A 40 ft radius around the creature gets covered in [liquid lava](../../environmental-hazards/lava.md) 3 ft deep. Creatures in the area, or that move into it, are immediately partially submerged.\

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Boss Mechanics**</mark> - Whenever a besmolder is staggered, instead of its usual effects, it can can only shoot 2 eyestalks on its turn. When it is dazed, instead it can only shoot 1 eyestalk. When it is stunned, its eyestalk ability is disabled, but it can otherwise act normally.

When a besmolder is siphoned, instead of its usual effects, its primary eye closes and it cannot use its gaze.

Whenever a besmolder is blinded, instead of gaining the blinded condition, its eyestalk DC decreases by 2. Blurred vision is instead converted into -1 to its eyestalk DC.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Story Time!**</mark> - A besmolder knows much more than even it knows. If prompted to tell stories, its knowledge of history is unmatched and it can practically "remember" anything with vivid detail, though it often exaggerates details to make the story more interesting. When it does so, its history bonus is effectively +30. By making a DC 30 history check, you can parse what parts of the story are facts and which are fiction.
