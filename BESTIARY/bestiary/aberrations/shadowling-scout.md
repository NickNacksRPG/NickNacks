<mark style="color:red;">**Possession (Su) \[recharge]**</mark> - A shadowling can transform into a vapor and advance rapidly towards a creature within 30 ft of them, inhabiting their body.

<mark style="color:orange;">Same or Lower Level</mark> - The shadowling takes control of the creatures actions (will negates). During the possessed creatures turn, instead the ing acts. All damage taken by the host also damages the ing possessing the creature (up to a maximum of the hosts current hp). At the end of each turn the ing possesses, they get a new save to end the effect. The shadowling can choose to end this effect as a free action. When it fails or ends, willing or not, they appear within 10 ft of the creature they targeted.\
<mark style="color:orange;">Minion</mark> - The shadowling has full control over the creature while it possesses them. The effect has no save and lasts indefinitely. The shadowling takes damage equal to half the damage its host takes (up to a maximum of half hosts current hp). The ing can choose to end this effect as a free action. When it ends, willing or not, they appear within 10 ft of the creature they targeted.
