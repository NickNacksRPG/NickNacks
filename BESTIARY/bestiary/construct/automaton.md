If this attack defeats the target, it flies 1,000 ft into the air and gently lands on the ground one minute later. With a low roof, the creature is launched less high, but for just as long.

On the following turn it must recharge, and reduces its speed to 15. If it ever uses the discharge option of static field, overdrive cannot be used again until rest.
