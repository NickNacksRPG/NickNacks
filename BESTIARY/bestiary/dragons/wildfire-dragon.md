<mark style="color:green;">**Immune**</mark> - Fire

<mark style="color:green;">**Rooted \[healing]**</mark> - As a swift action while groundborne, a wildfire dragon can cause roots to shoot out of its legs and burrow into the ground, allowing it to take the total defense action and reduce its speed to 0 this turn.

If it remains rooted (aka it doesn't move or isn't forcefully moved), it total defenses again each turn for free. It also regains 20 hp at the start of its next turn.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Steady Flight**</mark> - Dragons cap at clumsy 2 while flying. They can take flight as a free action

<mark style="color:green;">**Stomper**</mark> - Dragons do not provoke AoOs from leaving a threatened square against creatures that are knocked down.

## <mark style="color:orange;background-color:red;">Offense Traits (DC 23)</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**Bite (P)**</mark>  +16\
3d8+4 (17)

<mark style="color:red;">**Tail (C)**</mark>  +16 (+free knockdown attempt, +4 knockdown)\
2d6+4 (11)

<mark style="color:red;">**Multiattack**</mark> - Make a claw and a tail attack.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**Innate Techniques**</mark> - \
1/day - Man Drop,&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**Seismic Setup \[earth]**</mark> - As a swift action, a wildfire dragon can slam the ground with its tail near a creature within reach, causing the earth to crack like a seesaw, sending the creature into the air and causing them to land 30 ft away from their starting position knocked down (reflex reduces to 10 poise damage).

<mark style="color:red;">**Breath Weapon (Su) \[recharge] \[fire]**</mark> - 10d6 (35) fire (reflex halves) 60 ft cone. \
Any greenery in the cone is instantly turned to ash. Trees and other wooden objects are scorched. If an object is already scorched, it turns into ash.

The breath weapon recharges when the dragon uses its timber feature.

<mark style="color:red;">**Tail Swipe**</mark> - As a swift action while grounded, a dragon can make a quick turnaround and swipe at foes it threatens with its tail. Creatures take (10+lvl) poise damage (reflex halves). Poise broken creatures are knocked down.

<mark style="color:red;">**Scale Shatter \[fire]**</mark> - Every time a wildfire dragon drops to a threshold noted in "wooden scales," many scales break rank and explode, embedding themselves in nearby surfaces (and creatures). Creatures within reach take 4d6 (14) pierce damage and creatures within 30 ft take 2d6 (7) pierce damage (reflex halves). Creatures that fail their save have scales embedded in their skin, dealing 2d6 (7) fire damage at the start of their turns.

The scales can be removed automatically as a swift action, or as a free action if the creature possesses the medicine skill.

<mark style="color:red;">**Fissure \[earth]**</mark> - If a wildfire dragon senses a creature with its tremorsense while burrowed underground, it can appear suddenly and violently. It shatters the ground within 30ft of the position it exits the ground from.&#x20;

This ability only functions on unsuspecting creatures. When using it, creatures get a perception check (DC 22) to notice. Those that fail to notice are entangled and silenced while crushed inside cracks in the earth and unable to breathe. If a creature rolls at least 32 on perception, they can push them to safety, treating them as though they noticed the fissures.

This does not require an action and is intended to be used as an opener in place of stealth.

<mark style="color:red;">**Boss Actions**</mark> - Usable 1/turn.

<mark style="color:orange;">Timber \[recharge]</mark> - At the end of another creature's turn, take a bite out of a tree and cause it to fall in a direction of the wildfire dragon's choosing. This essentially functions as a line attack whose distance depends on the size of the tree. All creatures in this line take 4d6 (14) crush damage, are knocked down and entangled (reflex negates). The knockdown condition cannot be removed until the entangled is removed first.\
Creatures can attempt to escape using athletics as a standard action. Dealing 30 damage to the tree is also enough to free a creature, or 15 slash or fire damage.\
Cannot be used in consecutive turns (chew your food!).\
<mark style="color:orange;">Begone!</mark> - Use seismic setup at the end of another creatures turn.\
<mark style="color:orange;">Pin</mark> - Usable when a creature moves adjacent to a wall while within reach. The dragon makes a melee attack that deals tail damage and entangles the creature on hit. This entangle lasts until the wildfire dragon is no longer threatening the creature or it is poise broken.\
<mark style="color:orange;">Friction \[fire]</mark> - If a creature within reach is currently entangled, a wildfire dragon can end the condition by dragging the length of its entire body against the creature rapidly. This automatically sunders the creatures armor (or shield if the creature chooses), deals 8d6 (28) slashing and fire damage and inflicts a unique T3 affliction.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Boss Mechanic: Wooden Scales**</mark> - A wildfire dragon has surprisingly soft and vulnerable scales, so it has developed a unique form of protection. It uses its magic to form a wooden scale exoskeleton on the outside of its body. As the wildfire dragon fights, it gives off heat which burns away these scales, leaving itself vulnerable, but giving it greater mobility.

When a wildfire dragon reaches 210 hp, and every time it loses 50 more (160, 110, 60, 10), a layer of the scales explodes violently, activating scale shatter, decreasing the dragon's AC by 1, but increasing its speeds by 10. Healing past this threshold does not allow them to regain this AC or use scale shatter again.

<mark style="color:blue;">**From the Ashes**</mark> - Wildfire dragons must consume the ashen remains of creatures in order to replenish the protection from their wooden scales. They need a supplemental supply of ashes with their usual meals over the course of a week to regain 1 layer of scales. They typically bury themselves somewhere near their supply.

## <mark style="color:yellow;background-color:yellow;">Other Traits</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Ability Scores - Str +4, Dex +4, Lucc +0, Int +1, Wis +1, Cha +0**</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Dragon Senses**</mark> - Echolocation (30 ft), scent (10 ft), Darkvision, Tremorsense (30 ft)

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Ashen One**</mark> - Whenever a wildfire dragon uses an ability with the \[earth] tag, or its timber ability, and a significant pile of ash is on the ground within 5 ft of its AoE, it kicks up a 20 ft radius cloud of ash that persists for 3 rounds.

Creatures can see things through 10 ft of ash with partial concealment. Anything past that is total concealment. While within a cloud of ash, creatures without proper protection against harmful gasses are sickened 1 \[fort negates]. This is a \[persistent] effect. The wildfire dragon cannot be sickened by this.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Stache**</mark> - A wildfire dragons "mustache" hair is quite dexterous, allowing it to perform tasks that require precision, such as sleight of hand.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Speed**</mark> - 30, fly 30, burrow 30 (+10 per scale shatter)

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Overland Flight**</mark> - When allowed to fly long distances high in the sky, a dragon can fly 600 miles a day, or 1000 if it fatigues itself and never stops to rest. It can continue moving this fast for consecutive days by becoming drained 1 each day it does.
