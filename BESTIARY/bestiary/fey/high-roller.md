<mark style="color:green;">**Blessing of Frogg Saran**</mark> - High rollers receive a unique blessing from their patron deity. Whenever they take damage type (fire, crush, force), there is a 1 in 6 chance they are resistant to that damage type for that day, including the instance of damage they just took. Once they fail to gain resistance to a damage type, they don't roll it again for the rest of that day.

Keep on rolling baby.

<mark style="color:red;">**Lucky Break**</mark> - A high roller gets its name from its ability to pull wins out of its ass from seemingly nowhere. Whenever it rolls a d6 and rolls a 6, it rolls an additional d6. This can happen infinitely.

<mark style="color:red;">**Loaded Dice \[recharge]**</mark> - By blowing on a standard dice (a d6) and throwing it up to 30 feet, a high roller can cause it to explode. Deals a number of d6s of force damage equal to the end result of the loaded dice (reflex halves). This explosion is a 10 ft radius, with its center point on the ground where the dice lands.

For example, i roll a 4 on the d6. This ability does 4d6 damage.

Because of _lucky break_, this can potentially do infinite damage. If the high roller initially rolls a 6 when determining how many damage dice there are, this ability immediately recharges.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**"Nature Spirit" \[poly, true]**</mark> - A high roller has the ability to transform into a particular butterfly. They are typically exceptionally colorful and sparkly. They can speak while transformed. They use this form to tempt unsuspecting creatures into playing their silly games of chance.

<mark style="color:blue;">**99% of Gamblers**</mark> - A high roller is always enticed by games of chance, the higher the risk the better. They respect the results of such gambles, even to their own detriment. As such, high rollers are typically in crippling debt. Only 1% of them are filthy rich.

Rich high rollers typically have expensive magic items at their disposal.
