# Navigating the Bestiary

The bestiary is arranged first by the creatures type. Some creatures have multiple types and I decided to put them in the camp they felt more at home in.

Some creature types inherently have qualities, other just have a general vibe. Feel free to mix and match or add more!

Some monsters will have tags listed at the top of their entry. There are general tags, and some specific to creature types.\
One such tag is <mark style="color:green;">\[unique]</mark>. These creatures are one of a kind. They usually have more complicated game plans to their tactics and have a very distinct identity that is separate from other creatures of the same type. Often they are intended to be a singular specific creature.
