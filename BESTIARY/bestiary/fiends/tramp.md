<mark style="color:red;">**Go Fuck Yourself (Su) \[recharge]**</mark> - A tome imp can create a duplicate of itself to demonstrate its debauchery, giving it advantage on any checks to seduce. Until one is attacked, both are considered real, and can cast spells, attack etc, but does not give additional actions or movement. While a duplicate is active, either one getting targeted with an attack, spell or other harmful effect causes it to disappear.

<mark style="color:red;">**Tramp Stamp (Su) \[curse]**</mark> - By performing sexual acts with a tramp, it can inflict a curse on its partner that slowly turns it into a tramp (will negates). Keep a running tally starting at 15. Every day that goes by while abstaining from sexual activity subtracts 1 from this value. Every time the creature partakes in a sexual act it adds 3.\
Each additional sex act performed with tramps instead adds 7. Reaching 0 removes the curse. Reaching 30 transforms the creature into a tramp.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Well-Read (Su)**</mark> - By poise breaking a tramp with a hard cover book in hand, you can seal it inside of the book until someone reads it or the book is destroyed. This is why they are often called "tome imps."

Certain types of magical books can keep tramps trapped inside indefinitely. With planes or religion proficiency and 100g of holy water or purified salts, you can bless the book to turn it into a prison for the tramp. They can only leave the book by having their name called while the book is open. When they are outside of the book, they cannot interact with the book, except to enter it again. They cannot move more than 60 ft away from the book, getting dragged along with it if it happens to move. They are compelled to follow the orders of whoever summoned them, unless they are obviously harmful, though they are under no compulsion in how they enact their orders, and often use it as an excuse to tempt their masters.

A tramp can be freed if the book is destroyed, or by muttering an incantation written in the books sealing magic.
