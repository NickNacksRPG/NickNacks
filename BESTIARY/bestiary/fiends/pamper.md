<mark style="color:red;">**Master**</mark> - A pamper regularly grows attached to creatures, preferring fiends or fiendish creatures, particularly the charismatic ones. They can give themselves the \[companion] tag, receiving all the benefits. They get a +8 bonus to perception and survival checks to locate or track their master.

If enough time passes without seeing their master, or they find their master dead, they start a quest to find a new master.

<mark style="color:red;">**Protect \[elusive]**</mark> - When master takes damage, spend an immediate action to dash to their side at lightning speed. Move 50 ft closer to master and make an AoO against the creature along the way.

<mark style="color:red;">**Special Attack: Pounce**</mark> - By taking a jump action before attacking, roll a grapple attack with advantage. If the pamper succeeds, the creature is also knocked down as long as they are grappled.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Pet Pal**</mark> - Pampers tend to act more like animals than they do intelligent creatures. While they might not be the brightest, they still possess the ability to reason and speak. They only speak unless they absolutely have to, preferring nonverbal vocalizations. They will also speak if they believe they are alone with their master.

They can roll disguise to appear as an unusual animal, though any creature with planes proficiency automatically sees through this ruse.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Vengeance**</mark> - If their master is defeated or slain in the presence of the pamper, the pamper is taunted by the creature that killed/defeated their master. This taunt does not end until the pamper is slain, the target is slain, their master is healed or the pamper is otherwise unable to detect/attack the target.

If they evade vengeance, the pamper gains the +8 bonus usually reserved for their master against their target for 1 week.
