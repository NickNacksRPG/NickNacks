<mark style="color:red;">**Flexicution**</mark> - Fang forces a creature within reach to roll an opposed athletics check. If they win, she provokes an AoO. If she wins, the creature is crushed, dealing 4d6 (14) crush damage and inflicting drained 1. If this defeats the creature, she can immediately foe toss them.

<mark style="color:red;">**Breath Weapon (Su) \[fire] \[recharge]**</mark> - Fang unlocks her jaw and unleashes a torrent of concentrated flames in a 60 ft line. Affected creatures take 6d6 (21) fire damage and are set ablaze (reflex halves dmg and negates ablaze).

<mark style="color:red;">**Abyssal Rift (Su) \[concentration] \[persistent] \[recharge] \[necrotic]**</mark> - Fang slices the ground with her axe and temporarily opens up a rift to the underworld. A 15 ft line in front of her cracks open and becomes inaccessible, shunting all creatures in the AoE to the side. Damned souls reach for any creatures within 15 feet to pull them into the rift. They roll a +13 drag attempt immediately against all creatures within 15 feet, and passively when a creature walks into range. All poise broken creatures are partially dragged into the rift before getting ejected, taking 6d6 (21) necrotic damage.

The rift persists for 1 minute and has a 1 minute cooldown.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Choice Attire**</mark> - Whenever Fang is subject to an effect with the \[air] tag, she always spends her immediate action to keep herself covered up. If she is unable to, she is shaken 1.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Flattery**</mark> - By rolling a DC 20 persuasion or deception check as a standard action, a creature can fluster fang, causing her to be charmed by them. Succeeding on a second check gives her the time out condition, provided there are no obvious signs of continued aggression or betrayal. Any fiends of her level or lower automatically stop fighting at her request. Higher level fiends require persuasion from her.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Hey Mom**</mark> - By expending prayer, Fang can communicate directly with her mother, The Cataclysm, as though upcasting [sending.](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2kNIiIcUKxqLFlLgDKSI/magical-techniques/larella/level-1/sending)
