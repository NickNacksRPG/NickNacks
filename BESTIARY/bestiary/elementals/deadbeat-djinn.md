<mark style="color:red;">**Stench Aura \[poison]**</mark> - A deadbeat djinn has a natural musk. Creatures within 5 ft of the djinn are made sickened 2 until they leave this aura.

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:purple;">Weaknesses/Deep Lore</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Lucky Contestant! \[curse]**</mark> - A deadbeat djinn lives in bottles of discarded alcoholic beverages, revealing itself and its horrid stench only when someone attempts to drink from this unusual looking empty vessel. If someone is unlucky enough to encounter this creature is now cursed to live with this creature for 1 week. It will inject itself into social situations with its outdated and offensive opinions, it will ruin the mood at gatherings and it will steal all of your alcoholic beverages.

While this curse persists, you cannot escape the djinn, and its vessel is always in your pocket, bag or conveniently between you and your drink. If you use its wishtidigitation feature, you can decrease the amount of time they follow you around for by 1 minute.

If you spend downtime thinking about random wishes to make, you decrease the duration of the curse by (int+1) days.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Wishtidigitation**</mark> - A deadbeat djinn is a master of only the most obscure magics, functioning in ways that defy all reason or sense. They are able to perform great feats, but only when the end result would not be particularly beneficial, only interesting, quirky or mundane. If the object or information in question can be considered useful, it the deadbeat djinn cannot perform it.

If you wish for your date's favorite flower, then the deadbeat djinn can teleport you _A_ flower, but not the one you are looking for. They can teleport the flower from another planet, but it looks like another flower on the current planet and has no medicinal properties. The more impressively mundane the better.

Trivia on dead commoners, the number of breaths you've taken during your life, the number of grains of sand in the world compared to planets in the multiverse are all just one "I wish..." away.
