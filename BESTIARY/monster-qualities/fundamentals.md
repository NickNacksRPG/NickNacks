<summary><mark style="color:green;">Natural Attacks</mark></summary>

## _**Natural attacks always have the light property.**_

It's very common for monsters to have sharp claws and teeth, but having more claws and more teeth doesn't necessarily lead to them having more attacks. In a typical bestiary stat block, a monster will have sets of attack actions each with their own specified stats.

If a creatures stats mentions the multi-attack property, then when they take a standard action to attack, they are allowed to make multiple attacks of the specified types. Some creatures have conditional multiattacks.

<mark style="color:green;">Example</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**Sting (P)**</mark>  +3\
2d6+2 (9)

<mark style="color:red;">**Multiattack**</mark> - Can only be made against creatures with a speed of 0 (entangle, stun etc). \
Make 2 sting attacks.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Innate Casting</mark></summary>

Some techniques can be granted outside of the standard progression, such as things gained from race, class, magic items, specialized training, or some kind of boon granted by another creature. Usually quite limited in scope and much more common on monsters.

_**Innate techniques do not take up memory slots and are always memorized.**_

Innate techniques grant creatures the ability to use a specific set of techniques.  Spells do not require the staff/seal component that other casting typically requires. If a spell has a material or focus component, that is also ignored with innate casting. By default, creatures with innate techniques can use their techniques an unlimited number of times. Number values are included next to techniques that have limited uses per day.

Mana burn still applies to innately casted spells.

If a spell is constant, the spell is persistently active on the creature and takes up its \[buff] slot. A new buff can be cast on it, rendering the constant spell inactive. If it's constant spell is deactivated, it can reactivate it as a swift action.
