# Groups

Packs of beasts, platoons of soldiers and swarms of insects are all groups of weaker enemies that have slightly different representation than a typical monster. Group type enemies have a few quirks

## <mark style="color:green;">Universal traits</mark>

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="184"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AoE Vulnerability</td><td>Take 50% more damage from any AoE effect</td></tr><tr><td>Single Target Resistance</td><td><p>Resistance to any damage that only affects a single creature, most common with attack rolls. Certain attacks like cleave can ignore this resistance.</p><p>Single target effects that deal no damage have no effect.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Poise Resistance</td><td>Cannot be poise broken</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <mark style="color:green;">Other traits</mark>

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="129"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Distraction</td><td>When a creature takes damage from certain group enemies, they can be overwhelmed by the sheer number of creatures. They are staggered for one round (fort negates)</td></tr><tr><td>Swarm attack</td><td>Common with insects. Does not threaten. These creatures cannot make attacks and must instead enter a creatures space to deal their damage automatically at the end of their turn. This allows them to damage multiple creatures if they are close together with a big enough swarm.</td></tr><tr><td>Auto attack</td><td>Does threaten. Any attacks they make automatically hit. If they choose to combat maneuver, they deal 20+lvl poise damage.</td></tr></tbody></table>
