# Offense Traits

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Aura (Su)</mark></summary>

A creature has the ability to generate an area of effect surrounding them.  Some are passive some require activation.&#x20;

All auras are \[persistent] effects, meaning creature can only be affected by a negative aura once per round.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Breath Weapon (Su)</mark></summary>

The creature has the ability to use a supernatural area of effect attack.  Common forms include lines and cones of elemental damage.

Most breath weapons are \[recharge] effects that have some condition to use them again.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Deathrattle</mark></summary>

An effect happens when the creature dies, requiring no action. This typically involves exploding or releasing toxic gases.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Gaze (Su)</mark></summary>

Merely by looking at another creature nearby, they can inflict some kind of effect.  The creature can use a standard action in order to gaze at a specific creature within 30 ft. Some creatures have gaze attacks that automatically happen to all creatures within a specific range.

Anybody combating a creature with a gaze attack has a few options to try and negate it, made when they first are affected by the gaze attack.

* They can choose to close their eyes (instant action), giving themselves the blinded condition until the start of their next turn, making them immune gaze attacks.
* Alternatively they can choose to avert their gaze, giving them blurred vision and advantage on saves against gaze attacks.

Gaze attacks can be avoided entirely by looking at the creature through a proxy, like a reflective surface.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Grappling Abilities</mark></summary>

<mark style="color:green;">Attach</mark> - When the creature grapples another creature it instead gains the grappled condition, typically due to its smaller size. Creatures with the attached property typically have special abilities that can only be used while attached.

<mark style="color:green;">Constrict</mark> - When a creature with the constrict property succeeds on a grapple check they automatically deal damage from a specified attack form. Every turn they maintain the grapple they also do this effect.

<mark style="color:green;">Engulf</mark> - When the creature succeeds on a grapple check they can engulf the target. The target gains the entombed condition. Usually the creature can take no action other than to use athletics to escape.

Allies can use athletics to pull you out or poise break the creature to set you free.

<mark style="color:green;">Swallow</mark> - After successfully grappling a creature, the creature can choose to swallow its prey if it is at least one size category larger. The prey maintains the grapple penalties and the swallowing creature doesn't need to take any actions to maintain the grapple. The prey gains total cover and takes a specified amount of damage the turn it is swallowed immediately and at the end of the swallowed creatures turn thereafter.

A creature cannot use its swallow quality while sickened 2 or higher. Becoming sickened 2 causes it to vomit any swallowed creatures.

The prey escapes automatically when the swallowing creature is defeated.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Powerful Charge</mark></summary>

The creature gets a +2 bonus to attack during any round they make a charge.

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Summon Ally (Su) [companion]</mark></summary>

Functions like a [summoning contract](https://app.gitbook.com/s/s2e4XAiS8YASeBqQCRG7/equipment/magic-items/interesting-items/summoning-contract), but does not require a contract, usually only summoning lesser creatures. Only requires a standard action and can potentially summon multiple creature at once.

Can also grant other bonuses to summoned creatures, in addition to the companion boost to attack.

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Trample</mark></summary>

Creature can move around through other creatures spaces to knock them over.

Some creatures may have different effects for their venom, but this is the assumed default if no other details are listed.

1 minute after the creature fails its first save, it must roll again or hit stage 2.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">Stage 3</mark> - Creature is sickened 3, which cannot be removed until the creature is no longer poisoned. The creature gains the defeated condition.

In stage 3, a creature must roll a save every 10 minutes. Each failure adds a stack of drain.
