# Defense Traits

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Amorphous</mark></summary>

<mark style="color:green;">Example</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Amorphous</mark> - +15

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Damage Reduction (DR)</mark></summary>

Damage reduction (shortened DR) is a unique defensive property that comes in two different forms. Whenever a creature takes damage that their DR applies to, reduce the damage by the corresponding amount.\
Denoted as follows.  The x represents a numerical value.

<mark style="color:blue;">DR x</mark>\
Only applies to physical damage (Crush, slash, Pierce) and poise damage. Some instances of DR only apply to poise damage from specific combat maneuvers

<mark style="color:blue;">DRA x</mark>\
Applies to all damage types (minus true damage)

All forms of damage reduction stack with each other.  Damage reduction applies in the most advantageous way possible for the creature (after halving from saves or resistances for example). If an attack's damage is reduced to zero, any additional effects the attack would apply do not occur.

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Fast Healing</mark></summary>

The creature gains specified amount of hp the start of their turn if they are not defeated. When the creature is defeated, this ability is disabled for 10 minutes (see [medicine](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/medicine) for other means to keep those pesky healers down).

If a creature with FH is bleeding, roll a luck check (DC 10) to see if the bleeding stops at the end of their turns.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Ferocity</mark></summary>

When the creature is reduced to zero hit points, they are not defeated until the end of their next turn.  On said turn they are staggered.  If a creature with ferocity is healed before their next turn, the creature is not defeated at the end of its next turn, and this ability is not consumed, however they are still staggered.

This ability can only activate once per minute.

FH does not function while in ferocity.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Incorporeal</mark></summary>

Incorporeal creatures have resistance to crush, slash and pierce damage. They cannot be combat maneuvered without special equipment or techniques. Incorporeal creatures universally have hover speeds.

Incorporeal creatures can pass through physical objects, but cannot end their turn inside of one. This allows them to ignore cover bonuses and more easily hide.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Immunity</mark></summary>

Rare defensive quality.  This creature is immune to a specific type of status effect and/or damage type.

A common one is mindless creatures (creatures that lack an intelligence score, denoted by a - in the ability scores section) are immune to mind-affecting effects like fear and charm.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:green;">Resistance</mark></summary>

When a creature has resistance to a type of status effect or damage type, the creature takes only half damage from effects that deal that damage type.

When a creature has a resistance to a tag, it lists the numerical value that it gets a bonus to saves against abilities with that tag (such as \[fear] \[charm] etc).

{% hint style="success" %}
Creatures with resistance to poison also have a +4 bonus to the envenomed condition
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Regeneration</mark></summary>

The creature regains a specified amount of hp at the start of their turn. This healing is capable of restoring lost limbs over a few days, or instantly if the limb is reattached.  At the start of this creature's turn it loses the defeated condition, restores HP, and the creature is staggered instead of dazed.

All forms of regeneration have some means to stop it (typically for 1 round), usually taking a specific type of damage.&#x20;

If a creature is defeated while its regeneration is disabled, it is unable to regenerate for 10 minutes (see [medicine](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ffUc9JSjKiYL5XuDfVdc/skills/medicine) for other means to keep those pesky healers down).
