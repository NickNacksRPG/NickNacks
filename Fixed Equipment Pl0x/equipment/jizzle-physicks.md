# Jizzle Physicks

A core part of a life of adventure is taking damage, and your friendly neighborhood alchemists have you covered. As part of your starting gear (or a fee of 50g if you lose yours) you gain access to a flask of wondrous physick with a regenerating ooze creature inside of it called a jizzle. When called upon, your jizzle will do its best to repair your body.

Functions as follows...
