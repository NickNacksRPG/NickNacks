# Tracking Device

## <mark style="color:green;">2,000g (DC 13 engineering)</mark>

This tiny device is about the size of a peanut and resonates with psionic energy. You can attune to it by concentrating on it while in contact with it for 1 minute, provided you don't have negative intelligence.

More importantly, it can fit inside of a creature's body. With engineering or medicine proficiency, you can implant this device into a creature. The process is painful and obvious, so it can usually only be done on knocked out creatures.&#x20;

While implanted, you can know the general direction and distance of any tracking device you have attuned to. Each tracking device has a slightly different signal, allowing you to tell which one is which, provided you have the mental capacity to do so. You can be attuned to (1+int) tracking devices at once.

If the creature ever receives medical examination, a DC 20 medicine check also reveals a strange bump, or an unusual ache that indicates where the tracking device is, and it can be removed.
