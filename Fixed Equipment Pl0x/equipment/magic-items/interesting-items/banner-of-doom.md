# Banner of Doom

## <mark style="color:green;">7,000g (DC 15)</mark>

This flag is inscribed with symbols of fiends, prominent criminal organizations or evil mages. Those that exist within 30 ft of the banner while it is planted (a standard action) hear whispers from it, causing them to become shaken 1, unless they are allied with the group the banner's iconography showcases.

This has no effect on creatures that are already shaken. If the creature was not already shaken when it entered the area and it leaves the area, the shaken the banner inflicts immediately dissipates as the whispers vanish.

A creature can roll a DC 15 athletics check to push the banner over.
