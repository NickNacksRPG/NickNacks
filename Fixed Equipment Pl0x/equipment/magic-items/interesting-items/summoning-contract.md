# Summoning Contract

## <mark style="color:green;">Price Varies, See Details Below</mark>

Summoning contracts are written in order for a creature to provide aid to another without following them around all the time. There are always 2 parties involved in a contract: the summoner and the summoned. Typically it is up to the summoner to convince the summoned to sign the contract, as the magic does not work with unwilling creatures. It is possible to find summoning contracts with a signature from a summoned creature, but not a summoner. Contracts are often temporary, being lifted after a certain number of summons, or after a specific task is complete.

When the summoned creature signs the contract in blood, so to must the summoner. The summoned creature takes up a \[companion] slot while summoned. 1/day as a FRA, you can summon the contracted creature. Creatures summoned in this way always have a pseudo-ethereal translucent quality to them that is easily identifiable (DC 10 arcana). A summon typically only lasts a minute, but can last up to an hour if the summoned creature accepts <mark style="color:green;">summoning sickness</mark>. The creature also gains summoning sickness if it drops to 0 hp while summoned.

<mark style="color:green;">**Summoning Sickness**</mark> - A specific type of ailment that occurs as a result of a summoned creature pushing themselves too hard while summoned from a summoning contract, usually by sticking around for too long or being defeated. The creature is drained 2 and cannot be summoned for two weeks, even if the drain is removed.

In most aspects, a summoned creature functions exactly as they would if you were fighting by their side in their actual body, with a few key differences. As a magical effect, they can be dispelled (DC 12+summoned creatures lvl). They have all of their gear and any resources that they expend (such as potions) while summoned are still expended when they return to their body. Summoned creatures only have 50% of their max hp.

To the summoned creature, when you attempt to summon them, they receive a mental message from their summoner no longer than 2 sentences. They can choose to deny being summoned if they pass a will save (your class DC). If they succeed, they can send 2 sentences back. Otherwise, they enter a trance like state and their spirit leaves their body and appears next to you. If their body takes damage, or is otherwise harmed, then their spirit immediately winks out of existence.

A summoned creature can dismiss itself as a standard action. A creature can only be summoned once per day.

<mark style="color:green;">The more powerful a creature is, the more expensive it is to bind them to a summoning contract.</mark>
