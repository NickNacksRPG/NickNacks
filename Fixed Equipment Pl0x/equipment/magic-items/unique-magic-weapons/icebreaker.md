# Icebreaker

## <mark style="color:green;">1,500g (DC 11)</mark>

This mace is a cool blue color and, when wielded, the air around is visibly chilled as though it was exhaling on a cold day. It excels at crushing ice, and can easily smash through any type of icey barrier less than 1ft thick. Anything thicker becomes something of a mining operation. If a creature is frosty, or otherwise mostly made of ice, the mace does an additional 5 damage and makes it clumsy 1 on-hit. \
It has the following special attack...

<mark style="color:green;">Rime Time</mark> - \
Make a swipe at the air and target a 30 ft cone. All creatures in the area take 2d6+lvl (7+lvl) cold damage and are made frosty (reflex halves and negates frosty).

The mace is a 1h crush weapon with the CM (Sunder) and one and done properties.
