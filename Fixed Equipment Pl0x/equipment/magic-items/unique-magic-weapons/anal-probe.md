# Anal Probe

## <mark style="color:green;">3,000g (DC 14 Engineering)</mark>

This baton looks unimpressive until you press a button on its side to coat it in a strange liquid and electrify it as a swift action. It can remain electrified for 1 minute before it must recharge for 5. When you thrust it, it seems to magnetize to the target's orifices.

It is a 1h light club.

When electrified it instead deals 2d6 zap dmg. It also gains a special attack.

Shove the probe in whatever hole the creature is most uncomfortable with. They are clumsy 2 on-hit.
