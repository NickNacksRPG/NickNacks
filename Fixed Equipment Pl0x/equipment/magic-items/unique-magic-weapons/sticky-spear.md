# Sticky Spear

## <mark style="color:green;">3,000g (DC 13 Alchemy or Nature)</mark>

This long, pointed piece of wood is covered in a sticky sap. The wielder cannot change weapons using the swapping gear action without first spending a standard action to attach it to another object and pulling it off. \
However the spear is very fickle. Whenever you disarm a creature, it leaves you behind and hops directly into your targets open hand.

It is a 2h pierce weapon with the reach, CM (disarm) and attached properties.
