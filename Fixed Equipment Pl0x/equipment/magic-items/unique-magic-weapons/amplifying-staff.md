# Amplifying Staff

## <mark style="color:green;">2,000g (DC 12)</mark>

Favored by bards, this light staff shimmers in the light. If you hold it up to your mouth, it doubles the volume of any vocalizations. By spending a swift action to increase the mana cost of any ability with the \[healing] tag by 1 (or adding a mana cost of 1), you can increase its range by 10 feet, or its radius by 5 ft.

The range/radius extension can be done as a free action.

<mark style="color:red;">Manathirst 22</mark>\
The range/radius extension no longer requires mana.



It is a 1h crush weapon.\
Also comes in a battle staff and light variant, like most staves.
