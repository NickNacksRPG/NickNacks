# Scrappy Swordfish

## <mark style="color:green;">8,000g (DC 16 Nature)</mark>&#x20;

This fish was subject to a magical ritual akin to taxidermy after all of the useful parts were removed. The fish is a bit small for its kind, but it is certainly as sharp. It remains rigid even when clashing with metal swords. 1/day you can say a brief prayer to Mother Earth as a swift action and the fish briefly springs back to life. It immediately readies to parry, allowing you to decide which attack to deflect during the next round of combat.&#x20;

If you worship Mother Earth, you can use a point of prayer to parry with this weapon.

The fish is a 1h pierce weapon with the CM (disarm) and one and done properties.

Despite being gutted and undersized, the fish is still rather heavy and weighs 20 lbs.
