# Wheel of Momentum

## <mark style="color:green;">Expensive (9,000g)</mark>

This strange item is a large shield-like weapon with glowing blades along its edges that constantly circle the outside of the weapon. Because of this motion, it is ill-fitted to be used for defense. Every time the user misses an attack roll with it, the blades circle faster and glow more vibrantly, giving the wielder +1 attack that stacks with each miss. Once you land an attack, the speed resets back to default, removing the attack bonus.

This stacking effect cannot be used outside of combat.

It is a 1h slash weapon with the one and done and attached property.
