# Ogrelord's Whip

## <mark style="color:green;">2,000g (DC 12)</mark>

Unlike the standard whip, this whip is capable of threatening, but only your allies. When you make an AoO against an ally, it always does 5 slashing damage and increases their speed by 20 this round. You also gain a charge, up to 3. Each charge you can spend as an free action to increase the bonus of your next attack by +2 (max +6).

Charges are lost when you roll initiative.

See whip in [exotic weapons](../../weapon-rules/exotic-weapons.md) for more details.
