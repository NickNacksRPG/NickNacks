# Armor and Shields

Armor does not decrease your speed. \
Gain poise equal to the armor bonus the armor gives.\
Heavy armor imposes a -2 penalty to stealth checks.\
Dex column decides how much dex you get to add to AC.  If it has no value, your dex doesn’t add or subtract from your AC.

If you do not meet the armor's strength requirement, your speed is reduced by 30 (minimum 5).

Shields

Shields do not passively give AC. Instead they give you poise and additional combat options. If you un-equip a shield, you immediately subtract the bonus poise it grants (min 1).&#x20;

&#x20;<mark style="color:green;">ALL Shields</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Shields Up (Immediate)</mark> - Raise your shield. You gain resistance to any damage originating from a ranged attack roll until the start of your turn. Can be used on attacks targeting allies within reach instead, but ends if they leave your reach. \
<mark style="color:green;">Block (Immediate)</mark> - Decrease the bonus to an incoming attack by 2. If it grazes, it instead misses completely. Can be used on attacks targeting allies within reach. Multiple creatures can block the same attack.

## <mark style="color:green;">Tower Shields</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Tank Up (15 ft of movement)</mark> - Plant your shield to gain total cover from one particular direction. Essentially defends you from all attacks originating from a cone in that direction. A creature within 5 feet of you behind your shield gains cover, but only from a direct line. On subsequent turns reduce your movement by 15 to maintain this.\
You can choose to attack from behind the shield, but it gives cover instead of total cover.\
Using other shield abilities ends tank up.\
You can only use tank up once per turn, forcing you to stick to a particular direction.\
You cannot tank up in the same turn you charge.\
<mark style="color:green;">Blast Shield (Immediate)</mark> - When you fail a reflex save, gain resistance to the damage taken.
