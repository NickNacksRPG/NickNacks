# The Buckler

## <mark style="color:green;">Buckler</mark>

Buckler doesn't count as a shield and doesn't provide any passive defensive bonuses. Instead you get access to the parry ability. You can still interact with objects with a buckler on hand, but bucklers cannot be used if the hand is occupied.

<mark style="color:green;">Parry (standard)</mark> - Prepare yourself for an incoming attack. When you are attacked, you can choose whether or not to parry it. If you do, roll an attack as an instant action. If your attack roll is higher, the attack is negated.\
You can decide to parry an attack after the result of the roll is revealed.
