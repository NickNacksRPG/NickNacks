# Special Attacks

{% hint style="warning" %}
All weapons come with some of these special attacks, based on the damage type they deal, or their weapon type (ranged, melee, shield etc).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Special attacks by default recharge after being out of combat for 1 minute.

You can swap weapons to gain more special attacks, but you cannot use special attacks with the same name more than once in the same combat. Most special attacks require a melee attack, unless the weapon is ranged.
