# Weapon Rules

Unarmed strikes deal 1+str/dex damage. You don't threaten with unarmed strikes unless you have the unarmed combatant feat. Unarmed strikes can be used to non-lethally dispatch enemies to not kill them when defeated.&#x20;

Weapons come in 4 main categories: light, 1 handed, 2 handed, ranged.

The weapon type determines how many additional qualities it can have, its weight and its damage. I've made a handful of example weapons in the next page. Exotic weapons break the mold.

<table><thead><tr><th width="106">Type</th><th width="130">Weight</th><th width="73">DMG</th><th width="96">Weapon Points</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Light</td><td>2</td><td>d6</td><td>2</td><td>Can use dex instead of strength automatically comes with light weapons.

Non ammunition ranged weapons are assumed to be 2h</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some weapon qualities, like chink magnet, require you to not dual wield. You can still wield 2 weapons, but you only get the bonus during turns you only attack with one.
{% endhint %}

## <mark style="color:orange;">One-Handed</mark>

<table><thead><tr><th>Quality</th><th width="397">Description</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Attached</td><td>Can only be used when attached to something else, specified with each weapon.<br>DR 10 vs disarm.</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>One and Done</td><td>When not dual wielding, get +2 attack and the damage dice increases to d10 </td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <mark style="color:orange;">Weird</mark>

Some qualities feel out of place on general categories. Use as appropriate.

<table><thead><tr><th>Quality</th><th width="446">Description</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Attached</td><td>Can only be used when attached to something else and you wield that something else. <br>Typically attached weapons are things like hook hands, shield/armor spikes and bayonets.<br>DR 10 vs disarm.</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>
