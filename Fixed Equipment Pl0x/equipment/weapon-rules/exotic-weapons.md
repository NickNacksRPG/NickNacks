## <mark style="color:orange;">Lance - 2d6 pierce, 2h, Reach (10 lbs, 500g)</mark>

\- While mounted, a lance can be wielded in one-hand while still benefiting from 2h crit damage.\

## <mark style="color:orange;">Net - Thrown, CM (Drag) (5 lbs, 100g)</mark>

\- Nets deal no damage, but instead inflict the entangled condition on hit\
\- The entangled condition can be removed by a creature succeeding on a athletics check (class dc) as a standard action, or automatically as a standard action if wielding a slash weapon.\
\- You still benefit from the CM (Drag) feature of the net as long as the creature is entangled.\
\- You can use nets to make drag combat maneuvers against targets within 20 ft. When you drag with a net, you forfeit entangling your target\
\- Nets can only be used once per combat since they must be refolded again to be effective

\- Boomerangs return to the user when thrown automatically, allowing multiple attacks with a single thrown weapon.\
\- Boomerangs curve, allowing you to hit opponents with total cover, so long as you aim for the correct space\
\- Boomerangs do not return when caught with something like a goo dragon's sticky\
