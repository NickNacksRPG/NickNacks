<mark style="color:blue;">**Vehicle**</mark> - Standard rocks are streamlined to be useful as transportation and shipping vehicles, but leave a lot to be desired in terms of their combat capabilities. If attacked, a rock is helpless to stop its attacker aside from running away. As such, rocks must be kept away from danger.

## <mark style="color:yellow;background-color:yellow;">Other Traits</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Ability Scores - Str +0, Dex +0, Lucc +0, Int -, Wis +0, Cha +0**</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Speed**</mark> - 100 land, increases to 45mph out of combat.\
In ideal conditions, such as well-maintained roads, a rock can travel about 1000 miles a day, assuming it travels through the night, or 600 assuming it doesn't. These speeds are halved when moving through areas without well maintained roads, and reduced to 1/4 if you are traveling through wilderness with unwieldy terrain, such as snowy, sandy, mountainous or forested biomes. Some rocks come with specific terrains in mind and ignore such penalties.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Camouflage**</mark> - Wherever rocks are common (most places), it requires a DC 25 perception check to notice a rock is abnormal when it is not in use. A rock can hide any kinds of custom augmentations while camouflaged, including decorative additions like paint jobs.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Autonomous**</mark> - A rock is programmed to move towards specific well known destinations, in cardinal directions, or to move the path of least resistance towards a set of coordinates. If the rider wishes, there is also a driver's seat that allows them to more finely control the rock's movement. The autonomous driving controls leave a lot to be desired for sleeping passengers. You can get some sleep, but you do not gain the benefits of rest unless you stop to sleep.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Seating/Storage**</mark> - Rocks have compartments that can be easily hidden when not in use, both for seating and for storage. Standard rocks have seating to comfortably accommodate for 20 medium creatures. Such seating is protected from the elements via a weak magical barrier, capable of stopping small insects, wind and rain, but not arrows and swords.\
They can carry up to 5000 lbs in a compartment that is 8x8x8ft.
