# ðŸª¨ Rocks

It's not a boulder, it's a rock! Rocks are the premier transportation and shipping vehicles in the world of Nack. They are incredibly fast, cheap and can plop down anywhere and look natural because they're rocks.

Rocks are construct creatures that have their programming optimized for navigation and high speed transportation. More details in the stats subsection.

## <mark style="color:green;">Pricing</mark>

A standard rock costs 1,500g.

If you would only like to rent one, you are typically limited to predesignated paths, such as state roads. It costs 10g for short trips within 600 miles, 30g for something between 2-6 days and 80g+ for anything longer.

Prices for augments are included below. Using augmented rocks multiplies adds 50g to the price to rent them, with particularly expensive ones being even more expensive or unavailable for most customers.

If the rock is lost, destroyed or damaged, the owner/company that provided the service expects compensation for replacements/repairs.
