# Holy Water

## <mark style="color:green;">100g</mark>

Holy water is an item that is regularly created by churches and sold to commoners as a form of protection against the profane. Many fiends and undead have an aversion to this substance, and can often cure diseases inflicted by them and prevent some of their supernatural abilities.

The most common use of holy water is as a weapon. You can throw a small bottle of it as a thrown weapon. It deals 2d6 (7) holy damage on hit.

Many uses of holy water require its direct application, such as on wounds inflicted by the profane, or directly on the remains of the profane to put their spirits to rest.&#x20;
