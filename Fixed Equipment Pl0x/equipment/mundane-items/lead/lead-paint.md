# Lead Paint

## <mark style="color:green;">100g per bucket</mark>

Lead paint is the most convenient and cost effective way method of preventing scrying from would be spies over large areas. However it is a much more temporary solution. The high concentration of lead in the paint, as well as the additional binding agents, causes the paint to peel much more often and release a toxic gas that can cause problems over time. This requires a monthly cleaning and reapplication to maintain the anti-divination properties.

A bucket of paint can cover the average sized room. Larger rooms with high roofs require many buckets.

Buckets of paint are typically used for smaller private meeting rooms.
