# Lead Container

## <mark style="color:green;">Varies</mark>

Lead containers are mostly made of other metals like iron, steel, or for the particularly paranoid, adamantine. There is a layer of lead that prevents divinations of the container entirely. To anybody scrying on the area, the container (and its content) is completely invisible.

A small container for handheld items like books, the family jewels or light weapons costs <mark style="color:green;">2,000g</mark>

A medium container for sizable items like great weapons, or your rock collection costs <mark style="color:green;">5,000g</mark>

A larger container for very large items like humanoid bodies or golden toilets or costs <mark style="color:green;">12,000g</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Care must be taken when dealing with lead containers. There are methods of detecting lead and it usually indicates somebody has something to hide. In addition, if you place objects on a lead container, one could infer the location of something important since they would appear to be floating in midair while scrying.
