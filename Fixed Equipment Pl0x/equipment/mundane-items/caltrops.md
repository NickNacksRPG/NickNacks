# Caltrops

## <mark style="color:green;">500g</mark>

Caltrops are small pointy objects designed to harm creatures that walk through areas where they are deployed. Every space a creature moves through occupied by caltrops, they take 2 piercing damage and start bleeding for 2 damage. A creature can avoid this damage by treating it as difficult terrain.

500g is the price attached to the package of caltrops that can be deployed immediately as a standard action. Treat it as a thrown weapon to determine the distance you can throw it. All spaces within 5 ft of its landing point are covered in these pointy bits.

If deployed beforehand carefully over 1 minute, a similar package can cover a 10 ft radius.

Caltrops can be swept up in the AoE of many effects, such as aqueous orb, causing them to be rendered ineffective.
