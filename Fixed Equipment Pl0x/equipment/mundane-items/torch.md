# Torch

## <mark style="color:green;">20g</mark>

Torches are sticks wrapped with some type of cloth, chemical or vegetable matter that is flammable. Torches give off bright light in a 20 ft radius around them, and dim light 20 ft past that.&#x20;

They can stay lit for up to 2 hours. Lighting and dimming a torch repeatedly can significantly decrease the amount of time they stay lit.

If a torch ends up getting wet, it becomes unusable. If a torch ends up clattering to the ground from being knocked over or disarmed, roll a DC 10 luck check to see if it goes out, using the luckiest fellow benefiting from it in the vicinity if it was not wielded by anybody in specific.
