Dragon Metal is often referred to by what its made into rather than as a material more often than not; Something like "dragon plate armor" or "dragon greatsword." It is made by combining a rare form of jewel, called dragonstone, with steel. When in the presence of a dragon, the dragonstone absorbs bits of expended mana over time and change color to match the color of the dragon's scales. The dragon metal that is created by this often superficially resembles the dragon whom the dragonstone absorbed its power.&#x20;

When dragon metal is made into a weapon, the weapon has a +2 flat bonus to damage. They also get a bonus special attack, selected from the attached list.

When dragon metal is made into a set of medium or heavy armor, it gives a +1 bonus to AC. It also gives resistance to an elemental damage type, based on the dragonstone used in its crafting, defaulting to fire. For light armor see dragonhide.
