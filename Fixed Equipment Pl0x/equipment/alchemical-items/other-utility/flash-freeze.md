# Flash Freeze

## <mark style="color:green;">Cheap, DC 11 (50g)</mark>

Creating flash freeze requires the scale of a frost dragon to create, but the scale is a reusable component. Only small quantities of this substance can be created and contained at once.

When poured over water, the oil pools on the surface and takes 1 round to spread out from the point of origin in a 20-foot radius. At the start of your next turn, the oil flash-freezes the surface of the water, creating an ice sheet over the affected area. Any 5-foot square of this ice can support \~500 pounds of weight. Weight in excess of this amount causes the entire sheet to crack and quickly break up. This ice sheet becomes unstable and breaks up on its own after 1 hour, or faster in a hot climate.

&#x20;This item has no significant effect when used against creatures.
