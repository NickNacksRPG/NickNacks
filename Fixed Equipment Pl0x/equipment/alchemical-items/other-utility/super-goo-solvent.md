This section mentions 2 different but interrelated items. Must be purchased separately.
{% endhint %}

A gooey substance gathered from goo dragons condensed and then separated into 2 components. Super goo takes all of the sticky qualities of a goo dragon and amplifies them. When exposed to open air for 1 round without being disturbed, it can bind any 2 surfaces to each other permanently. Nothing is stopping the objects from being torn or destroyed, however.

Super solvent can negate the adhesive properties of super goo, as well as other "sticky" things like spider webs.
