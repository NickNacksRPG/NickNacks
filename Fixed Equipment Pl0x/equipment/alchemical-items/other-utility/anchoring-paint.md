# Anchoring Paint

## <mark style="color:green;">800g (DC 20)</mark>

For creatures who dislike pesky mages, plants that drain mana can be mixed with paint in order to create a liquid that can be spread over surfaces. Typically the paint comes with instructions on how you draw the magic circles required to activate its potential.

A single can is enough to cover a 20 ft radius in a magic circles. Creatures cannot teleport to any surface that is warded by anchoring paint, or the air above it.

After the paint has stopped an instance of teleportation, it rapidly begins to evaporate over the course of an hour.
