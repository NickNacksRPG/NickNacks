# Barbarian Chew

## <mark style="color:green;">Common, DC 16 (600g)</mark>

These plants are rare occurrences in mountainous regions, but stand out due to their red leaves year round. With a little bit of alchemical alteration, they inspire fury in those that chew (and often consume) them.

For the rest of the day, you cannot use \[concentration] effects. The next time you rage today you gain 10 additional speed. When this enhanced rage ends, you cannot rage again until you rest.
