# Love Potion

## <mark style="color:green;">800g (DC 20)</mark>

By extracting the juices of a dead love bug, the complex process of creating a love potion can begin. The name is what everybody calls it, but its function is more in line with a toxin than a potion.

Care must be exercised when using love potions, for love is not an exact science. When a creature consumes a love potion, they become charmed and deeply romantically interested in the first person they see for 8 hours. At the end of this duration, the creature loses the charmed condition. It then makes a will save (DC 20 negates) to resist the effects of the potion or the romantic feelings become permanent.

In the event where the creature first seen is not romantically compatible, it instead forms a close platonic bond.
