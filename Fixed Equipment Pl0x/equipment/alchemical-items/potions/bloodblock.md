Bloodblock requires extracting toxins from creatures like mosquitoes and removing the itchiness. Many alchemists do this by crushing large quantities of common mosquitoes and using chemical separation processes.

Can be used to substitute for a med kit when treating bleeding creatures. Gives a +4 bonus said checks.
