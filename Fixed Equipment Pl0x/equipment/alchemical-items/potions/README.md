# Potions

Potions are small flasks that can be downed in one gulp and usually provide some type of positive benefit to the consumer.\
Some potions inflict potion sickness.

<mark style="color:green;">Potion Sickness</mark> - A creature with potion sickness cannot drink any other potions. Makes it so you can't drink in consecutive turns unless stated otherwise. (cycle goes as follows: drink, sick, drink etc...)
