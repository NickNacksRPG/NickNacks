# Allnight

## <mark style="color:green;">Cheap, DC 14 (120g)</mark>

Allnight is made from crushed nocturnal insects. The stimulant is similar to caffeine, but cranked up to 11. it is very easy to tell when someone is under the effects of all night due to their constant twitching/jittering and inability to remain focused.

Lasts 8 hours. You suppress the negative effects of fatigue and cannot fall asleep or be put to sleep, but take a -2 penalty to all skill checks and cannot do anything with the \[concentration] tag. You also do not gain the benefits of rest while under the effects of allnight.
