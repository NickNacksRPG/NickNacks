# Mana Potion

## <mark style="color:green;">Common, DC 18 (700g)</mark>

By melting down mana crystals, they can be converted into a tasty sweet potion that can be addictive.

Immediately restores 1 mana, but you mana burn 1, reducing your maximum mana. Normally mana burn also reduces current mana, but to keep the math simple, increase current mana by 1 and reduce max by 1.

By increasing the DC by 4, you can double the price and increase its restorative effects and mana burn by 1. This doubling in price/+4 DC is cumulative (DC 22 for 700g, DC 26 1400g, DC 30 for 2800g etc)

<mark style="color:red;">T3 and above potions are considered rare items due to their high craft DC.</mark>
