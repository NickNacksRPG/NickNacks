# Bottled Lightning

## <mark style="color:green;">500g (DC 14)</mark>

Typically alchemists create bottled lightning on stormy days, with some type of lightning rod to attract the lightning. They treat the interior of a bottle with a thin layer of a rubbery insulator and extract the stored electrical power into it.

When destroyed, the lightning lashes out at nearby creatures. Creatures within 5 ft take 2d6 (7) zap damage (DC 14 reflex negates).
