# Flash Powder

## <mark style="color:green;">Common, DC 11 (400g)</mark>

When thrown with enough force, a bag of flash powder reacts violently with a flash of light. Thrown at a creature's feet, it blinds for 1 round (DC 14 reflex reduces to blurred vision).

When consumed it makes the user feel very fast for no mechanical benefit.
