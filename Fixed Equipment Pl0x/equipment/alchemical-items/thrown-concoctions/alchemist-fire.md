# Alchemist Fire

## <mark style="color:green;">500g (DC 14)</mark>

Alchemist fire is one of the first things taught to alchemists and only requires a handful of common chemicals.

When exposed to open air, this combination of chemicals ignites. Creatures within 5 ft are set ablaze (DC 14 reflex negates).
