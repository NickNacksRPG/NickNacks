# Noble

You come from an upper ring of society. Your name might not carry the same weight everywhere you go, but your gold pouch certainly does.

You get a bonus 1,000 starting gold that you can spend as you wish. Your family also gives you an allowance every month of 500g. For campaigns with a faster or slower pace, such as if there are frequent time skips, consider changing how often the allowance comes in.

If you are far from home, it can take up to a week for your allowance to arrive. They can only ever be picked up from settlements.
