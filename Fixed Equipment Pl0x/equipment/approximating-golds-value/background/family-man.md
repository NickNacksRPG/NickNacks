# Family Man

You are the co-owner of a house somewhere in the world, usually at least on the tangent of civilization. You lived with either your immediate family, like parents and siblings, or you made a family of your own with a spouse and children.

You own a meager house in a specific place, and a handful of family members to come home to after an adventure. Your house is always considered a suitable place to rest in order to cure general afflictions.

Your family generally understands you won't always be back home for dinner, but going more than a month without contact will usually cause them unease, and may eventually cause them to move.
